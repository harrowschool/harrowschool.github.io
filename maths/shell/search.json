In short, when we represent percentages (or percentage changes) as decimals, we can multiply to work things out.\nIt turns out that in many cases this makes questions much easier, particularly when it comes to compound percentage changes.\nTo see how well they work and how much they can simplify percentage problems, let’s look at an example.",

    "text": "Example: Pocket Money\nYou get £10 a week pocket money. Unfortunately, you get a little lazy about revising for your maths exam, and so you don’t score as well as you could have if you’d worked harder. Your parents are concerned, and so they decide to reduce your pocket money by 10% until your results improve.\nYou pull up your socks and study hard for the next maths exam, and your score is much better. As a reward your parents increase your pocket money by 10%. \\[\n100\\% - 10\\% + 10\\% = 100\\%\n\\] All good then! Are you happy with the result?\n\nIn fact this logic is incorrect, because the two 10%s are not 10% of the same amount. \\[\n\\textsterling 10 \\xrightarrow{-10\\%} \\textsterling 9 \\xrightarrow{+10\\%} \\textsterling 9.90\n\\]\nPercentage changes do not add up.\nHowever, they do multiply. Let’s see.\n\n\\[\n10\\% \\text{ increase} = 100\\% + 10\\% = 110\\% = \\dfrac{110}{100} = 1.1\n\\] \\[\n10\\% \\text{ decrease} = 100\\% - 10\\% = 90\\% = \\dfrac{90}{100} = 0.9\n\\] \\[\n\\textsterling 10 \\times 1.1 \\times 0.9 = \\textsterling 9.90\n\\] The decimal multipliers give the correct result.\nThis is the key to this whole topic. Percentages do not add up, but they do multiply.\nThis way of calculating percentages is important in several areas of applied mathematics, particularly financial mathematics.",
