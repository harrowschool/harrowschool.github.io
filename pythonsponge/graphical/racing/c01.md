# Racing Game Stage 1

## Changing the car sprite

- make some changes to the car design
- be careful though; try it out after each small change!

## Extending the racetrack

- update the drawTrack subroutine to add a nested for loop
```
for x in range(GRID_SIZE):
  for y in range(GRID_SIZE):
    ...
```
- update the call to drawTrackSquare inside this loop to use both x and y parameters
```
        drawTrackSquare(x, y)
````

## Enabling up and down arrow keys

Here's the outline but try to figure out the detail yourself!
- update the Car dataclass definition to include a yDir attribute
- update the checkKeys subprogram to check for other key presses and to set yDir accordingly
- also update checkKeys so that if xDir is set to 1 or -1 then yDir is set back to 0 and vice-versa
- update the animate subprogram so that the car.row attribute is also updated accordingly similarly to the car.column attribute
- update the checkCrash subprogram to also check if the car.row attribute is now off of the grid and return True if so

## Extension for this lesson

- can you make the racetrack width larger than the height?
- when crashing at the edge of the grid, can you make the sprite stay visible but change icon e.g. show a crumpled bumper?
- can you make it display different sprites when going in different directions particularly left vs right?
