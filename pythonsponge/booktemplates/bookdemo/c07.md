# Advanced Test Cases for Turtle Auto-marking

Turtle solutions can be auto-marked by using the following advanced test case json as shown in the setup for this challenge.

It uses an out `typ` of `t` along with a specified `filename` which should contain the solution turtle code.

```json
"tests": [
{
  "in": [
	100
  ],
  "out": [
	{
	  "typ": "t",
	  "filename": "turtletest_sol.py"
	}
  ]
},
{
  "in": [
	50
  ],
  "out": [
	{
	  "typ": "t",
	  "filename": "turtletest_sol.py"
	}
  ]
}
]
```

Matching will compare the graphical output of the user's code with that of the code added in the solution file. It should be noted that matching will require similar drawing commands (in the same order) for the user's code to the solution code so it is best to give a clear template solution for these problems with gaps to fill.

For example, complete the code to make the turtle draw a red square of side length n pixels from its starting position as shown.

The value of n should be input by the user as a positive integer e.g. 100.
