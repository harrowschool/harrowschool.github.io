## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete this code to input two whole numbers from the user, `num1` and `num2`, and then calculate and output the result of num1 to the power num2.

For example if the user enters `2` and `3` then the printed output will be `8` because 2x2x2 = 8.

Reminder: ** is the power (exponentiation) operator in python.
