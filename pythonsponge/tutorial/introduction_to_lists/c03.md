# Introduction to lists
## Exercise 3 (example)

As well as reading items in a list, you can also change them.

In this example we have a list of numbers, not strings, and we change the 3rd number (i.e. the number with index 2).

Tip: notice how, when you print the whole list variable, you also get the square brackets in the output. We'll see later in the course how to get rid of those if you want!
