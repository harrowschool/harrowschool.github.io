# Introduction to lists
## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete this code to print out the first of the three animals entered by the user.

For example, if the user inputs `cat,fish,dog` then the final output should be `cat`.

Note that the code makes use of the string `.split()` method which splits some text into a list, splitting in this case at each comma.

Don't make any changes except completing the two gaps.
