# Iterating over lists
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete the four gaps to input a comma-separated list of letters from the user and output the number of times that `x` occurs **excluding** any times that the `x` is followed by a `y`.

For example if the user enters `a,x,x,b,x,y,x` then we have four occurences of `x` but one of them is followed by a `y` so we output `3`.

Note: our use of the not equals operator `!=` ... it returns `True` if the two operands are **not equal** to each other so we can check here that the next letter, if there is one, is **not** `y`.

Don't make any other changes to the code.

Extension: note that we have to ensure we don't try to read a next letter if we are currently considering the final letter ... otherwise we would get an index out of range error! It is possible though to write the inside of the loop as a single if statement if you construct it carefully without triggering an error because Python will stop evaluating a boolean expression once it knows the result - give it a go.

Extension: the wonderful world of regular expressions provide a shorter way to answer this question but that's for later in the course!
