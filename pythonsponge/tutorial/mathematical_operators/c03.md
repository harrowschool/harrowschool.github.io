# Mathematical operators
## Exercise 3 (example)

Three other important operators include:

`**` for powers (e.g. `2 ** 3` equals `8` since two cubed is eight)

`//` for integer division (e.g. `11 // 4` equals `2` since there are two fours in eleven, ignoring the remainder)

`%` for modulo which calculates the remainder of a division (e.g. `11 % 4` equals `3` since the remainder is three when you divide eleven by four

Run this code to experiment with these operators.
