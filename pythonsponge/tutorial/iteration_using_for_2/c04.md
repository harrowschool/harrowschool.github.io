# Iteration using for part 2
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete this code to print out the index positions of any vowels in a word.

For example if the user enters `rabbit` then the output should be `1` and `4` (on separate lines) because the character at index 1 is a and the character at index 4 is i.

Do not make any other changes except completing the gaps.
