# Iteration using for part 2
## Exercise 3 (example)

If we want the index and the character at that index in a string then we can iterate over the indexes and then lookup the character at that index.

Note: For extension, you can also look up how to use the `enumerate()` function which we will cover in a later tutorial.

Note: Try simplifying the range call to simply `range(len(word))` to show that it still works the same.
