# Selection using if
## Exercise 3 (example)

The `if...else...` statement provides for a second block of indented code which will execute if the condition in the if statement is not True (i.e. it evaluates to False).

In the example below the condition uses `<` (the less than operator) to see if the number input is less than `1000`.

Run this example again twice, once with `301` and once with `1000`.
