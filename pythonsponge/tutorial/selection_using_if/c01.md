# Selection using if
## Exercise 1 (example)

We can the if statement to only process the following indented lines if the condition given is true. 

We indent our lines with two or four spaces although this is a stylistic choice.

In the example below the condition uses `>=` (the greater than or equals operator) to check if the number entered is `100` or more ... if that check is `True` then the indented lines will execute, otherwise it will skip them.

Note that expressions like these are called boolean because they evaluate to True or False.

Run the following example twice, once with input `5` and once with input `100`.
