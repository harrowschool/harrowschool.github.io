# Selection using if
## Exercise 4 (task)

Add an `else` clause to the code from Exercise 2 (repeated here) so that it also prints `incorrect` if the wrong password is entered. It should always still print `thanks for playing`.

Don't forget the colon at the end of the else line just like the colon at the end of the if line!
