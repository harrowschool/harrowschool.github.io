# List appending and removing
## Exercise 3 (example)

As well as adding items to a list you can also remove them.

There are different ways of doing this but for now we will use the `del` keyword to remove an item at a particular index as shown in this example.

Extension: you can also delete items from the end or at a particular index using the .pop method and the .clear method can also be useful. You can look these up now or we will return to `.pop()` in a latter tutorial.
