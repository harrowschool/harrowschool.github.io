# Variable types and converting
## Exercise 1 (example)

We earlier mentioned variables as being named containers/memories for values that should be stored.

Variables have different types which specify the sort of values they contain.

The most important simple types are `integer` (for whole numbers), `float` (for decimal numbers), `string` (for text) and `boolean` (for True / False).

Strings (text) are initially specified either in quotes or as the result of user input which always gives a string regardless of what the user enters

Note the difference in how the `+` operator performs if applied to two strings compared with when applied to two integers.
