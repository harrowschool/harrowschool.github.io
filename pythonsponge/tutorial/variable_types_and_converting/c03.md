# Variable types and converting
## Exercise 3 (example)

To convert user input, which will always be a string, into an integer (whole number) or float (decimal), we have to use the two functions `int()` and `float()`.

The use of `int()` is shown below ... note how the first first result printed comes from string addition (also known as concatenation) and the second result comes from integer addition.

Converting between data types is also known as casting.
