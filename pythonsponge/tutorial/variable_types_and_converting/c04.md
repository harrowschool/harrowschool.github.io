# Variable types and converting
## Exercise 4 (task)

This time we want to try inputting and adding two decimals.

If you try running the code (same as last exercise) below and enter two decimal numbers e.g. `4.7` and `3.8` then you will get an error message. Can you see why this is?

Change the code by swapping the `int()` function for the `float()` function on the two times it occurs so that we can then add decimals. 

Note however that float (decimal) variables can suffer from some precision error (e.g. try with `1.2` and `2.4`). We will look at ways of dealing with this later in the course.
