# Mathematical Functions
## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete the gaps to ask the user for some comma-separated decimals and their rounding choice (1-3 for ceil/floor/round 0dp).

Then calculate and output the integer total of their numbers using their elected rounding method.

Note that the ceil/floor functions give integer outputs but the round function gives a float output so if you round to 0dp you need to combine round with the `int()` function as well if you require an integer as in this case.
