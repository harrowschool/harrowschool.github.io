# Mathematical Functions
## Exercise 3 (example)

Another useful function in the math library is `sqrt()` to find the square root of a number.

Here we find the square root of pi and compare it to the common approximation 177/100 to find the percentage error of the approximation to 2dp.

This example also demonstrates that we can use the `math` library to access an appoximation for pi.
