# Repetition using while
## Exercise 1 (example)

We can use the `while` statement to repeat lines of (indented) code based on some condition which, if `True`, continues the loop.

Run this simple example which continues to double and output a numbers while it is less than or equal to `1000` (i.e. it continue until the number is first greater than 1000).

Note the colon at the end of the `while` line and the indented code which indicates the lines to be repeated.

Each time 'round' the loop it will evalate the check `num <= 1000` to ensure it is still `True`.
