## Exercise 4 (task)

Input a list of mixed-case firstname and output a left-aligned box of names as shown below with a header and footer row which is `20` characters wide in total.

For example if the user enters `Amy,Alexander,Artemis` then the output should be:

```
+------------------+
|AMY               |
|ALEXANDER         |
|ARTEMIS           |
+------------------+
```

Don't make any other changes apart from completing the gaps.
