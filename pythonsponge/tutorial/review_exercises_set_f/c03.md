## Exercise 3 (task)

Complete this code to find and output the index at which the word `and` starts for the *second* time in a sentence the user enters.

For example if the user enters `red and blue and yellow` then the output should be `13`.

Note how we can substitute the first `and` with `---` whilst leaving other occurences unchanged by providing a third parameter of `1` in `.replace(MATCH, "---", 1)` to specify a maximum of one replacement.
