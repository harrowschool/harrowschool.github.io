# Review exercises set F
## Exercise 2 (task)

Ask the user for a minimum weight as a decimal.

Then output a table of results with two centred columns to specify the furniture item and weight for all items in the list of at least that minimum weight.

For example if the user enters `14.1` then the output should be:

```
+----------+----------+
|   ITEM   |  WEIGHT  |
+----------+----------+
|  table   |   18.8   |
| bookcase |   14.3   |
| cabinet  |   32.1   |
```

Don't make any other changes apart from completing the gaps.
