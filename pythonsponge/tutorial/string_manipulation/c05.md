# String manipulation
## Exercise 5 (task)

Complete this code so that the `I like...` message also gets printed if the user mentions `elephant` or `zebra`.

Tip: we could simplify the code if we moved the `.upper()` right to the end of the first line and then we wouldn't need to repeat it in the if conditions. Give this a try as well!
