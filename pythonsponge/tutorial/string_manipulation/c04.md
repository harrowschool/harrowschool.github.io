# String manipulation
## Exercise 4 (example)

We can use the `in` operator to see if a certain string is contained in another string.

[if you want to find exactly where it occurs you'll need to lookup how to use the `.index()` method]

Run this example and try entering `cat` and `scatty dogs`.

Can you see why it does find the first word in the second phrase?
