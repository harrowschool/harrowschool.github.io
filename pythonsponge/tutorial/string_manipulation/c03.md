# String manipulation
## Exercise 3 (example)

There are lots of string manipulation and validating methods. We will look at more on later pages but you can also get a sneak preview here.

We will just meet a couple here. Run this example below to convert a word to upper case before checking if it is then equal to `FISH` regardless of what case the user entered.

Try entering lowercase `fish` to show that the if condition still passes.

There is also a `.lower()` method as well to convert to lower case as well as `.isupper()` and `.islower()` which returns `True` or `False` if the word is all upper case or all lower case respectively.
