# String manipulation
## Exercise 1 (example)

We saw earlier that you can add two strings together in a similar way to numbers : the two strings will be joined together (concatenated).

You can also access individual characters in the string using square brackets and an index number - starting from 0 which is the index of the first character. Negative indices will count from the back of the string.

Run this example and try entering `cat` and `dog`. Can you see why the outputs produce what they do?
