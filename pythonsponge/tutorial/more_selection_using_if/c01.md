# More selection using if
## Exercise 1 (example)

We can insert additional `elif` clauses into our `if` statements to test for additional true conditions if our previous clauses all fail.

Note that each condition will be checked in turn from the top of the if structure...the first time a `True` condition is found then that indented block of code will execute and it will no longer check any remaining clauses.

Should none of the `if` or `elif` conditions be True then the `else` block, if present, will execute instead.

Run the following example three times: find inputs which make each of the print statements appear.

Note also our use of the logical `or` operator here to allow us to check two possibilities in one condition.
