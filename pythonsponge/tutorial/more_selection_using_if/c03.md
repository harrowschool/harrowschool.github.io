# More selection using if
## Exercise 3 (example)

In this example, we show how we can test ranges of a number by using the fact that the `if...elif...else` statement stops checking conditions once it has found its first `True` condition.

Run this example three times, once with input `5`, once with input `15` and once with input `25`.

Note that the second clause does not need to say 'elif num >= 10 and num < 20:' because the first condition check already ensures that num must be at least 10 otherwise it wouldn't reach the latter checks.
