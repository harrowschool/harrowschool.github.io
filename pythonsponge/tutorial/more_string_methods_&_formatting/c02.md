# More string methods & formatting
## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete the gaps to input a word and print out the letter immediately after the first occurence of the letter `x`.

If this isn't possible because `x` does not occur or only occurs as the final letter of the word then print out impossible instead.

Don't make any other changes.
