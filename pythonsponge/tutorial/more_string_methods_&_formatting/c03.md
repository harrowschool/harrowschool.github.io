# More string methods & formatting
## Exercise 3 (example)

Another useful string formatting instruction is to left-align, centre, or right-align an expression within a certain number of allowed spaces.

Note that after the `:` in the formatting expressions, we specify `^12` which means centred in twelve spaces.

Try changing the `^` to a `&gt;` for right align!
 
Tip: Note the American spelling of `center` here.
