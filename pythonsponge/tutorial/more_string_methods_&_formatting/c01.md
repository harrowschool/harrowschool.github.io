# More string methods & formatting
## Exercise 1 (example)

We've already seen a number of string methods now including `.upper()`, `.isdigit()` and `.split()`.

If we are looking for the start index of a particular character or word in a string then we can either use `.find()` or `.index()` as shown here.

`.find()` is a little safer because it returns `-1` if the search text is not found rather than triggering a runtime error which `.index()` does in that case.
