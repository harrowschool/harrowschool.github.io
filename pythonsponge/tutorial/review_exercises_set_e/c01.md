# Review exercises set E
## Exercise 1 (task)

Complete this code to ask the user for a five letter word and then print out an anagram of the word in the order: middle-letter, last letter, first letter, fourth letter, second letter.

Note that you can convert a string to a list using the `list()` function.

Tip: there was no need to convert the word into a list of course...you can index characters directly from a string so you can try deleting line 2 and replacing references to `letter` with `word` instead. That said it can be useful sometimes to convert to a list e.g. if you wish to use other list methods such as `.append()` or `.insert()`.

Extension: could you rewrite this code to use a `.format()` string method instead e.g. starting with 

```
LAYOUT = "{}{}{}{}{}"
```
