# Review exercises set E
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete this code to allow the user to build their list of top sports.

The user repeatedly adds a new sport (or stop to finish) and then enters a position to add it or types end to add it to the end.

Note that we subtract one from positions entered by the user because indexing starts from zero.

Don't make any other changes apart from completing the gaps: some starting letters of the gaps have been provided to help you.
