# String slicing
## Exercise 1 (example)

We saw earlier how to access individual characters in a string e.g. using `name[0]` for the first character and `name[-1]` for the last character in the string name.

We can also 'slice' a string which means accessing a range of characters e.g. characters from index `1` up to but not including index `4` say as shown in this example.

Note: play around with some other slices in the above example e.g. try `word[1:-2]` and `word[:3]` (for which 0 is assumed as the start) and also `word[-4:]`.
