# String slicing
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete this code to input a word from the user and a positive whole number to indicate a letter position (starting from 0). Output the same word but with that letter removed.

For example, if the user inputs `chops` and `1` then the output should be `cops`.

Only complete the blanks; you do not need to make any other changes.

Extension: what happens if the user enters a position which is greater than the valid letter positions for the entered word? Or a negative position?
