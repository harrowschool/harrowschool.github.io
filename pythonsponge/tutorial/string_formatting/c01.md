# String formatting
## Exercise 1 (example)

A clearer method for creating output messages can be achieved by using string formatting.

We will start with the `.format()` method for this tutorial because it is more common in certified courses having been supported for longer.

By including one or more curly-brace pairs in a string, you can specify what should replace those braces by calling the `.format()` method on the string and specifying the replacement values as arguments.

Tip: try changing the expression in the last formatting method e.g. to `len(subject) * 2`

Extension: Note that you can optionally omit the argument index values in the curly braces and it will simply substitute the arguments into the curly braces in order e.g. try changing the `MESSAGE1` value to be:

```
MESSAGE1 = "you entered {} which has {} characters in it"
```

Extension: Look up the neater, more modern `f` string formatting method which we will see in a later tutorial.
