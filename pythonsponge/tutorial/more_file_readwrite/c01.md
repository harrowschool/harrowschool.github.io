# More File Read & Write
## Exercise 1 (example)

We can use the `.readlines()` and `.writelines()` methods of the file class to allow us to write or read a list to/from the file in one command.

This might be useful if we want the connection to the file object to be open for as short a time as possible. 

Notice however that we still need to manually include relevant new line characters if we want line separators in our output (i.e. every line except the first one needs to be prefixed with a new-line `\n` character). When we read these back in they will still be present in the list items and will need stripping using the `.strip()` string function.
