# More File Read & Write
## Exercise 3 (example)

This example demonstrate the append mode `'a'` to add additional content on to the end of an existing file.

Having closed the initial file write, if you want to add more data on to the end of the file you must open it in append mode next time with the `'a'` parameter to the open function.

In this example we finally open it again in read mode `'r'` to check and print all of the file contents.
