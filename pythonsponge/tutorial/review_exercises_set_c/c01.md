# Review exercises set C
## Exercise 1 (task)

Complete this code which is intended to ask the user for an original number which is then repeatedly printed and then squared until the terms go over one million.

For example if the user enters `3` then the outputs start as 

```
3
9
81
...
```

Do not make any other changes except completing the gaps.

Extension: try changing the squaring line to use the syntax num `**=` instead, similar to `+=`, for a shorter syntax!
