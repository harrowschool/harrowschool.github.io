# Review exercises set C
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete this while loop validation around the input line below so that the user will repeat the input line until they enter a two character string whose first character is uppercase and second character is lowercase.

Note how this uses square brackets after a string (covered earlier) to access characters from the string.

Do not make any other changes except completing the gaps.
