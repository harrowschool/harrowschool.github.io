## Exercise 2 (task)

The Fibonacci sequence starts 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... and gets its next term by adding the two previous terms e.g. the next term would be 13 (5 + 8).

Complete this code to print out all of the Fibonacci terms which are less than `50`.

Extension: in Python you can use multiple assignment which avoids the need for a temp variable so you could try replacing the last three lines with the single line `a, b = b, a + b` which is very satisfying!
