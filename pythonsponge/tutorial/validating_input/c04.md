# Validating input
## Exercise 4 (task)

The `.isalnum()` method can be used to test if a string is entirely alphanumeric (just consisting of a-z, A-Z and 0-9 characters).

Complete the gaps to validate a 5 charater alphanumeric inputted code.

Note: there is no need to validate for uppercase characters here because the code is converted to uppercase having been accepted.

Do not make any other changes except completing the gaps.
