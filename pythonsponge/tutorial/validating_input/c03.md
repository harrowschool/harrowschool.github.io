# Validating input
## Exercise 3 (example)

We can use the string `.isdigit()` method to test for digits 0-9 which can then be cast to an integer.

Note that we don't give an error message in this example for invalid input ... the input merely repeats which is often sufficiently clear.

Extension: you could look up the technical differences between `.isdigit()`, `isdecimal()` and `.isnumeric()`. Technically `.isdecimal()` could be the best one to use here but `.isdigit()` is most commonly used. None of the three methods will accept a negative sign or a decimal point so we use an alternative method for that (see later in the course).
