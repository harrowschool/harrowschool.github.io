# Validating input
## Exercise 1 (example)

We often make use of a while loop to validate user input - to ensure it is of the correct type or format that we expect and to re-request it if it isn't.

This example below requests and validates a 3 letter uppercase alphabetical code.

Note that, along with the use of the `len()` function to check that the string is 3 characters long, we also now introduce the `.isalpha()` and `.isupper()` methods which check a string and return True if they are all alphabetical characters (a-z or A-Z) and uppercase (A-Z) respectively.

Tip: you might think we only need the `.isupper()` and could remove the `.isalpha()` test but try removing it and then testing it with input `AR3` or `AR!`.
