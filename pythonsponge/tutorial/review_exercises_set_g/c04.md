## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete the `get_initials` function to take a list of strings as input and return a new string made up from the first letter from each item.

For example if the list `['dog', 'cat', 'frog']` is passed in then the string `dcf` should be returned.

Don't make any changes apart from the gaps.
