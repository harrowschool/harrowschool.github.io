# Review exercises set G
## Exercise 1 (task)

Complete this code to print out a list of ASCII numeric codes, their value in binary and their actual character for all characters in a given range requested 
  
e.g. for inputs of `65` and `66`:
  
```
65 01000001 A
66 01000010 B
```
  
Note: the code also demonstrates use of a string formatting code for formatting an integer as a binary 8 bit number.
