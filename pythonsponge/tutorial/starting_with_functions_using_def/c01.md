# Starting with functions using def
## Exercise 1 (example)

We can use the `def` structure to define functions: blocks of code with a name which can be used more than once in your program.

Functions which do something but don't `return` anything (don't give anything back at the end) like this example here are actually known as procedures but we still use the same def keyword for both.

This procedure below prints the chorus of the song whenever it is called.
