# Starting with functions using def
## Exercise 3 (example)

The job of a real function is to give something back to the calling code using the `return` statement.

The function below asks a human to do a small task to see if they are really human and then returns `True` (if they pass) or `False` (otherwise).

Note that the `result` variable receives the returned result from the called function and so will become either True or False.
