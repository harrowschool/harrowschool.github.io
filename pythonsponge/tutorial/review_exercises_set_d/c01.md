# Review exercises set D
## Exercise 1 (task)

Complete this code to input two positive numbers and count down from the first one in multiples of the second to give a count down of positive numbers (not including 0).

For example if the user enters `15` and `3` then the output will be 

```
15
12
9
6
3```

Tip: for the last of the three numbers for the range function you can use direct negatives in python e.g. `-num2` which is more concise than `-1 * num2`.
