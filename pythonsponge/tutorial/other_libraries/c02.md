# Using randint or randrange from the random library
## Exercise 2 (example)

We often want to generate pseudorandom numbers for our scripts. 

`randint(a,b)` generates a random whole number between a and b inclusive however `randrange(a,b)` generates a random whole number between a (inclusive) and b (exclusive) so we generally use the `randint` function unless seeking a symmetry with the normal python `range` function which is also exclusive at the higher bound.

Study, run and adapt the code to the left to experiment with its uses.
