## Exercise 4 (task)

Ask the user to enter a phrase that contains every vowel (a, e, i, o and u) at least once. If they do it then print `right` otherwise print `wrong`.

Note: it shouldn't matter whether the user's phrase is upper or lower case or where the vowels occurs or whether any of the vowels are repeated.
