# Function parameters
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete the blanks to continue to update a variable with the sum of its digits until its value is less than 10.

For example if the original input is `3297` at the start then:

```
current = 3 + 2 + 9 + 7 = 21
current = 2 + 1 = 3
```

Since 3 is less than 10 then 3 is the final output.
