# File Read & Write
## Exercise 2 (example)

We can now load your data back by opening the file for reading using an open mode of `r`.

Note how each line that is read back needs to be stripped using `.strip()` in order to remove the new line character from the end of each line.

[This last point can be somewhat confusing ... try what happens if you remove the `.strip()`. You then get a blank line inbetween each name because you have the new line from the end of each line of the text file and also the new line that the print() function automatically adds on by default.]
