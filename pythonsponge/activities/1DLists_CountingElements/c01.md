# Counting based on a condition

Input a single digit from the user e.g. 7.

Validate that the input is a single numeric digit and if not then output `invalid input` and stop any further processing.

For valid inputs, count and output the number of numbers in the list which contain that digit (e.g. 57.74 contains a 7 and so would increase the count by one).
