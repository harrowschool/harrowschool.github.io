# File Processing - Writing Lines

The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0,1` and then forms subsequent terms by adding the two previous terms.

Complete this program to read in a positive integer n from the user which is greater than 2 and create a file `fibonacci.txt` which contains the first n Fibonacci numbers, one per line. You can assume that a valid input will be provided.

Note: there shouldn't be a new line character at the end of the file.

**Example Input:**

```
8
```

**Example File Contents:**

```
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
```

**Extension:** validate the input to ensure it is an integer (type check) and is greater than 2 (range check).
