# Functions returning Results

This program requires a non-empty string and a positive integer as inputs.

These inputs must be validated and so the functions `getNonEmptyString` and `getPositiveInteger` should each use a loop to only return a result when a valid input has been obtained.

Rearrange the given lines to implement the two functions.

Also add code to the main program to call the relevant functions and store in the relevant global variables.
