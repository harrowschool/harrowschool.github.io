# Finding a maximum

Solar records in the given list each have three fields which specify the location id (integer), the capture date & time of the reading (string) and the electricity being generated in kwh at that time by the solar panels (float).

The code is already provided for inputting a (validated) location id and also a date in the form dd/mm/yyyy.

Process the records to find and output the LARGEST generation reading for that location on that day.
