# String Processing - Strip and Replace

Input a line of text which will consist of a sub-string of `b` and `a` characters surrounded either side by some asterisks e.g. `***baababaa****`.

First strip off all the asterisks at the start and end.

Next continually replace any `ba` matches found in the string with `b`.

Note that, in the case of `baa`, the result after the first replacement is `ba` which can then be replaced again with `b`. 

Continue to make such replacements until `ba` no longer occurs in the string. Then output the result.

Example input:
```
***baba****
```

Example output:
```
bb
```

Example input 2:
```
*baababaa**
```

Example output 2:
```
bbb
```

Example input 3:
```
****aba**
```

Example output 3:
```
ab
```
