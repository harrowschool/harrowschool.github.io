# Deleting Records

Input an age. You can assume only a positive whole number will be entered.

Delete all records from the `peopleRecords` list which have that age.

Output the updated list.

Note that using the `del` keyword will shift all the later indices down by one for remaining records so you don't want to increment your index counter if you perform a deletion.
