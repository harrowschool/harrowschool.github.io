# Build a list of records

Build a list of records which consist of two fields - an uppercase letter and a whole number.

The letters should start with 'A' and go up by two letters each record (ending in 'Y').

The numbers should start at 13 and come down by 1 each time (ending in 1).

For example the first three records should be:

```
['A', 13]
['C', 12]
['E', 11]
```
Output the final list of records.
