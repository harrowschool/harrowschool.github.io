# Sum of Ceilings

The user will input two positive whole numbers (0-59) to indicate two index positions in the list of decimal numbers.

Calculate and output the total achieved when each of the numbers within the range (inclusive) of those two indices is ROUNDED UP and then SUMMED.

Good practice tasks (not assessed):
- ensure suitable comments are added to the main loop
- ensure suitable whitespace between the input, processing and output sections
