# Sub-Programs - Processing Lists

Complete a sub-program which takes two lists as parameters and returns a list which has the elements of the two lists interleaved.

The sub-program should initially validate that the two lists are the same length and if not, output `ERROR WITH LIST LENGTHS` and return the empty list `[]`.

Otherwise it should create a new list to interleave the first item of the first list followed by the first item of the second list then the second item of the first list and the second item of the second list and so on. It should return this new list.

Example parameters:
```
['a', 'b', 'c']
['d', 'e', 'f']
```
Example return value:
```
['a', 'd', 'b', 'e', 'c', 'f']
```
