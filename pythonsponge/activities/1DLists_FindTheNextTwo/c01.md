# Find the next two

Input a whole number from the user.

Then search through this ordered list of prime numbers to find the first two numbers which are at least as large as the number entered by the user. Set these numbers to be the value of found1 and found2 respectively.

If only one number in the list is at least that big then only set found1 and leave found2 as 0. If there are no numbers in the list at least that large then leave both found1 and found2 as 0.

Good practice notes (unmarked):
- you should exit the loop when you know the values you need
- you should add suitable comments to aid readability
