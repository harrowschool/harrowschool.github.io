# File Processing - Reading Lines

The hidden file `names.txt` contains a list of firstnames e.g. 

```
Aryan
Julie
Adi
Freya
Marianne
```
Input a letter from the user e.g. `a` and print out any names (one per line) which start with that letter ignoring case in the order they occur in the file e.g.

```
Aryan
Adi
```
