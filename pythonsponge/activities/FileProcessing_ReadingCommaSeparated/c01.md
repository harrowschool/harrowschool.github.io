# File Processing - Reading Comma-Separated Lines

The hidden file numbers.txt contains some lines each consisting of two comma-separated numbers e.g.

```
4,8
7,3
5,4
9,2
```

Your task is to process the lines to calculate and output the total of the SMALLER of the two numbers of each line e.g. for the above file contents it would be `4+3+4+2` so `13`.
