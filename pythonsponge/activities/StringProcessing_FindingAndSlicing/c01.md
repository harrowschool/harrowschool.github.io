# String Processing - Finding and Slicing

Input a line of text.

Output the first 3 characters that follow the first `#` character in the text.

If `#` does not occur in the text then output `NOT PRESENT` instead.

If `#` does occur but there are less than 3 characters that follow the first occurrence then output 'TOO FEW' instead.

```
3Ky

```

Example output 2:
```
TOO FEW
```

```
a5Hn3Kyu1
```
