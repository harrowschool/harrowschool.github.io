# Sum the Pair Products

Multiply each number in the first list with its corresponding number (by index) in the second list.

Find and output the total of these products (multiplications).

Good practice tasks (not assessed):
- make sure you initialise any other global variables used
- make sure variables are meaningfully named
- make sure you add whitespace to separate the processing loop from the output
- ensure a meaningful message in your output
