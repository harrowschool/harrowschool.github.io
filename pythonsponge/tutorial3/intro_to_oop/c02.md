# Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Exercise 2 (task)

The eponymous term **object**, in Python, refers to anything that can be stored in a variable. `3`, `"carrot"`, `12j+3` (a complex number),
`(3, 5, "carrot")`, and `set((3, 5, "carrot"))` are various different objects.

Each object has a **type**: these objects, respectively, have types `int`, `str`, `complex`, `tuple`, and `set`.

As shown, Python provides types to represent basic theoretical constructs such as numbers, strings, and collections. But
in real-world codebases we sometimes want to represent real-world objects or more complex theoretical constructs in
code, and so we create our own **user-defined data types**. (The "user" here is not the end user of your program, but
rather you, the programmer, who are using the programming language.)

The object-oriented approach to user-defined data types is **classes**. If you've completed the A-Level tutorial content, you have
already seen some classes: dataclasses were introduces in the Creating and Using Records section. Classes, including
dataclasses, have much more functionality that we're about to explore. For now, refresh your memory of syntax by filling
in the blanks.
