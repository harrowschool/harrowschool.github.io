## Exercise 4 (task)

Rewrite this code, which uses a dictionary and several associated functions, to instead use a dataclass with several
methods. Make sure to change not only the definitions but also the usages of these functions.

Recall that attributes of a dataclass can be read using dot syntax, e.g. `person.children`, just like with methods but
without brackets to call it.
