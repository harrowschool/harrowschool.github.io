# Introduction to object-oriented programming

## Exercise 3 (example)

A dataclass or dictionary provides a good way of storing information about a real-world object – for example, the name
and age of a person. But objects also have behaviours – a person can become a parent, a list could have an item added,
a table of data could have its mean calculated.

We can implement the behaviours of a data type as functions as shown, but this can become messy because there's no
explicit link between the class and the function:
- The code is less readable because it's not clear that the function represents a behaviour of the class
- Different objects might have behaviours with the same name but different implementations, which would create naming
  conflicts
- If you want to reuse the code in a different file you have to import every relevant function individually.

We would prefer it if all the information about one data type were kept in the same place. If we use a class to
represent the data type, then we can define functions within the relevant class body, making the code more readable.
Such functions are called methods.

Pay particular attention to how the methods are accessed in the code opposite. First comes an object of the relevant
class, which becomes the first argument of the method; then a dot `.`; then the name of the method; then the remaining
arguments in brackets.
