# Hash Tables

## Exercise 3 (example)

One important thing about hash functions is that they **don't map every unique key to a unique address**, as there are a lot more possible keys than possible addresses. Hence, there are occassions when two different keys hash to the same address, which is called a **collision**.

**Collision handling** is the process of handling collisions so that both values can be stored in the hash table. There are two notable collision handling methods, **Open addressing** and **Chaining**. **Open addressing** is the method of **checking the next slot** in the array until an empty slot has been found to store the value, whilst **Chaining** is the method of starting a **linked list** at the current address and storing the value at the end of the list. Both methods handle collisions by **linearly searching** for the next available space, hence the time complexity of a lookup operation can degrade down to **O(N)**, where N is the number of items in the hash table.

These collision handling methods work well when N is relatively small, but as N increases, the chance of a collision also increases, causing the time complexity of a lookup operation to deviate from O(1), the ideal scenario. To mitigate this, the method of **rehashing** is used, which is the process of **creating a new hash table with a larger size** (often 2x), **recomputing the addresses** for all keys and **moving** them over to their new address in the new hash table. **Rehashing** is often initiated when the ratio of the number of items to the size of the hash table, also known as the **load factor**, is greater than some given number (e.g. 0.75)

This example shows how collision handling via open addressing and rehashing are applied to a hash table.
