# Hash Tables

## Exericse 2 (task)

Fill in the blanks to implement a working hash table without collision handling.
To compute the address, calculate the sum of the product of the index of each character (starting from 1) and the ASCII value of each character, then lastly mod it by the size of the hash table.

This hash function is an example of a better hash function than the hash function in the previous example, as by including the position, permutations of the same string would now give different addresses, whilst previously they would all hash to the same address. An ideal hash function would spread out all possible keys across the whole array so that the number of collisions is minimised.
