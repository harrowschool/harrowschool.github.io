# Hash Tables

## Exercise 1 (example)

A hash table is a fundamental data structure that creates a **mapping between keys and values** by **applying a hash function** to the key to get an **address** where the value is stored, typically in an **array**.

Hash tables are a sensible way of implementing a dictionary, which you will recall is a collection of key-value pairs accessed via the key.

Hash tables are **not the same** as dictionaries: a dictionary associates keys with values and could do this _however_ the data structure _chooses_ to store this. A Hash table is the specific implementation to use hash functions applied to the key to arrive at the address of where to store the value.

The use of the **hash function** is to be able to **quickly lookup** the value associated with a key in the hash table by computing the address from the key, and accessing the value stored in the array at the given address. Ideally, the time complexity of accessing an item in a hash table is **O(1)**, meaning that the time to access an item doesn't depend on how big the hash table is. However, this time complexity can degrade down to the very worst case of **O(N)** due to collisions which we will discuss later in this chapter.
