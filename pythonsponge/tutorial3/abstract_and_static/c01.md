# Abstract and Static Methods

## Exercise 1 (example)

In Object Oriented Programming, there are special types of methods: **Virtual Methods**, **Abstract Methods** and **Static Methods**.

**Virtual Methods** are methods in the parent class that have an implementation and provide the child class the option to override it. As a reminder, method overriding is when a method in the child class has the same name as a method in the parent class, so the method in the child class **overrides** the method in the parent class and is called instead of the **virtual method**.

**Abstract Methods** are methods in the parent class that **do not** have an implementation and **force** the child class to override it. Abstract methods do not have any code in them, and if they are called without overriding, it will produce an error. In python, abstract methods are denoted by the **@abstractmethod** decorator, which can be imported from the library **abc**. For this to properly work, you also have to import **ABC** (abstract base class) from **abc**, and inherit the class with the abstract method from **ABC**.
