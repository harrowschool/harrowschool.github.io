# Abstract and Static Methods

## Exercise 3 (example)

**Static Methods** are methods that **belong to a class definition but are not part of the objects it creates.**. This means that a static method does not use any attributes that are part of the class (i.e. the **self** keyword is not used at all). In python, static methods are denoted by the **@staticmethod** decorator, and the **self** parameter is omitted entirely.

Along with static methods, there are also **Static Attributes** that are part of a class definition but are not part of the objects it creates. These attributes are defined without the use of the **self** keyword, and in python, are typically defined after the class name but before the constructor. These attributes can be accessed by either using **class.attribute** or **self.attribute**, where the latter is only possible inside a method of the same class.
