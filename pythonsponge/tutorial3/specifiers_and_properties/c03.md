# Specifiers and Properties

## Exercise 3 (example)

In python, **getters** and **setters** can be implemented as two connected methods using a decorator as shown.
**getters** are denoted by the `@property` decorator, and **setters** are denoted by the `@<method name>.setter` decorator.

This allows the method to be called without the brackets following it, so it looks like it is accessing the attribute directly (but it's not!).

This can be particularly useful if you have previously implemented a public attribute but now wish to hide it: you could then create a new private or protected attribute but add a property with the same name as the old public attribute so that your legacy code which uses your class continues working.
