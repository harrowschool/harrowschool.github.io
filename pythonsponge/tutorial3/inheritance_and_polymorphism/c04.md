# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete the code to calculate the area of each of the shapes using polymorphism and overriding.

Note that this code also demonstrates the concept of an \*_abstract class_ which is one which has at least one abstract (undefined) method.

`Shape` here is an abstract class and is not meant to be instantiated directly, only by creating objects using classes which inherit from `Shape`.

See later in this chapter for how you can formally mark the class as abstract to prevent the creation of instances.

**Note for this exercise:**

- Rectangle, Circle and Triangle all inherit from Shape
- The area function for each subclass needs to be overriden
- Call the area method for each shape using polymorphism
