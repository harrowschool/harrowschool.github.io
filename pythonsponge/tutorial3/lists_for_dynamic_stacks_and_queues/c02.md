# List as Dynamic Stack
## Exercise 2 (task)
  
Complete the gaps to implement a basic word-by-word editor which supports an `UNDO` command to reverse the most recent `ADD` or `TOGGLE` instruction.

For example if the user enters:
`1`, `greetings`, `2`, `1`, `human`, `3`, `3`,`4`
then the final document text would change in the following fashion:

```
greetings
GREETINGS
GREETINGS human
GREETINGS
greetings
```

So the final document text would be just:

```
greetings
```
