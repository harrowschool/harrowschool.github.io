# List as Dynamic Queue
## Exercise 3 (example)
  
For a dynamic queue we need to be be able to remove from the front of the queue (i.e. `DEQUEUE`) as well as add to the end of the queue (`ENQUEUE`).

We can implement this dynamically (no fixed size) using the `.append()` and `.pop()` methods of a list.

It should be noted however that using `.pop(0)` as we do, to remove from the front of the list, is a slow operation if the list is large and students should explore the `deque` class from the `collections` module for a more efficient solution.
