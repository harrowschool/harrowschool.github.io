# Constructors and attributes

## Exercise 3 (example)

Often a class will have instances of another class as its attributes. This is variously referred to as either
**composition** or **aggregation**:

- If the child object can exist without the parent, it is aggregation
- If the child object cannot exist without the parent, it is composition

This distinction may be explicit not in the classes themselves, but in how they are used or how the code is conceived.

See the code for examples.
