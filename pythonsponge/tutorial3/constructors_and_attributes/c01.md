# Constructors and attributes

## Exercise 1 (example)

You may have noticed that the syntax for creating an **instance** of a class (an object whose type is that class) is
just like the syntax for calling a function. You are indeed calling a function when you do this; that function is
called the **constructor**.

For dataclasses, the `@dataclass` annotation writes the constructor for you, but more flexibility can be achieved by
writing it directly. Observe that with a dataclass, every line in the class body both becomes an attribute (can be
accessed from an instance of the class using a dot) and becomes a constructor parameter (passed into the constructor
function when the object is created). When writing our own constructor, we can define attributes as we choose.

The constructor has the special name `__init__` when defined, but is simply called by invoking the name of the class.
Observe the full syntax opposite. The first parameter is again called `self` and is implicitly filled with the object
which is being created; thus we can set attributes using `self.`
