# Constructors and attributes

## Exercise 2 (task)

Write the constructor for this class to calculate the following attributes based on the constructor parameters provided.

- The length and height should be calculated by subtracting the first pair of coordinates from the second
- The constructor accepts a colour name but the attribute should be filled by looking up that name in the dictionary
  `Rectangle.COLOURS`
- After all attributes have been set, the `draw` method should be called at the end of the constructor
