# ASCII Art
*constructed by Oliver Gibson*

ASCII art is truly the purest form of art! However, someone messed up when coding it (Plot twist: it was me.) Please fix it so I don't get in trouble.

## Task 1:

Fix the square so it isn't a rectangle!

## Task 2:

Fix the orientation of the rectangle. (check the height and width)

## Task 3:

Let the player quit by entering 5.

## Task 4:

Warn the player if they enter an invalid option.

## Extension Challenges:

- If the user enters an invalid choice, the program should let them try again until it works.

- Make it so the triangle prints as an Isosceles triangle and not a right angled triangle.

- Make the circle printing work, because right now it just prints a rectangle (Hint: You can use the distance function to check if a point should be printed as part of the circle)
