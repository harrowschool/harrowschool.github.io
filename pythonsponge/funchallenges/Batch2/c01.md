# Connect Four
*Constructed By Rob Earle*

Play the game first and then try the challenges below to improve it!

Afterwards, try the extension challenges.

## Task 1 
Modify a line of code towards the start of this code file to give names to the players using two inputs.

## Task 2
Add some code to check / diagonals for a connect 4, similar to the \ diagonals.

## Task 3
Currently there are no messages when the game is finished.
Output the winner or that it is a draw.
Note: for detecting a draw, you could change checkWon so that it returns three different results for ongoing/drawn/won.

## Extensions
1. add a third player to this game of connect 4
2. make the game board have more rows and columns
3. make the code ask the user to re-input their column choice when they try to play into a full column instead of raising an error.
4. change the column labels to be 1,2,3,... not 0,1,2,...
