# Mini Othello
*Written by Abhinav Gupta*

Othello is normally played on an 8 by 8 board but here we play it on a 6 by 6 for ease of use.

Players take it in turns to lay their discs.

Players are only allowed to lay a disc such that at least one of their opponent's pieces has to be between the disc they just played and another disc of the same colour (i.e. outflanked) in any direction horizontal, vertical or diagonal. All outflanked pieces are then flipped to become the opposite colour.

If a player can't make a valid move they can pass. If they have a valid move they are not allowed to pass. If neither player can move (i.e. two passes in a row) then the game ends and the player with the highest number of pieces on the board wins.

Play the game, then try the tasks to improve it! Then look at the extension challenges.


## Task 1
Add additional validation to the row and column inputs to check they are between 1 and 6 inclusive.

## Task 2
Extend the game over check to also end if the board is full (total of the scores is 36)

## Task 3
When the game is over output the result!

## Extension Challenges
- It currently allows players to lay invalid discs which are already filled or don't outflank any pieces. Stop this from happening!
- Change the board to its standard 8 by 8 size
- Don't allow a player to pass to if they do have a valid move
- Inform the player if they have no valid move and then pass automatically
