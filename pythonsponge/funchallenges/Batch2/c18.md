# Image to Text

_By Oliver Gibson_

Convert your images to text!

The goal of this code is to take an image but show a textual representation of it using ASCII characters.

To do this we will use the pillow image library to resize the image to a suitable size (with not too many pixels), then find the greyscale value of each pixel (0-255) and then convert each range of grey values into a particular text symbol.

First try running the code then try the challenges below.

The image we are initially trying to encode to text is [here](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQngA3sDiSoA46Dy56OLZjLKD1SqgsS3Qmh1A&usqp=CAU).

Notice that you won't be able to pull images from many sites because most have cross-origin resource sharing disabled but Google's gstatic thumbnail domain allows us to pull images directly and (see task 3 and extension) you can also use directly encoded base64 image links.

## Tasks

1. Increase the size of the text image to 50 or 100 characters so it can be seen more easily

2. Improve the scaling issue of square pixel to non-square characters by changing the number 1 in line of code indicated

3. Try moving the `IMG2` constant into the constants section and displaying it instead

4. Extend the menu system so the user has a choice of images to display

## Extension

- Try experimenting with different character sets in choice and length - see what works best
- Try finding other images to convert: you may need to use an online tool to turn them into base64 representation & then paste in a long URL!
