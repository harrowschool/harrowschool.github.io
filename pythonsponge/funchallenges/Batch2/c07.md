# Lossless Compression

This code uses a method called Run Length Encoding to represent the character art picture in compressed form using the format:

```
<character>*<frequency count>
```

...and with # used as a separator.

If you run it you can see it achieves a small file-size saving without losing any data (the original string can be perfectly restored).

## Task 1

Add in code where marked to calculate and output the percentage saving: can you make this percentage appear to 1 decimal place?

## Task 2

Can you recreate the original output but starting from the `compresedArt` variable?

You might find these two lines helpful:

```
for instr in compressedArt.split("#"):
    print(instr)
```
