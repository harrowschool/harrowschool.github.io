# Memory Game
*Constructed by Sahil Karanth and Oliver Gibson*

Play this memory game, trying to find pairs of the same item in the list.

Then complete the three tasks in the code.

## Task 1
Do a web search for suitable Unicode character to represent the back of a card and replace the `#` symbol on the line 3 constant with your new character.

## Task 2
Change the condition on the `while` loop so that the game only continues whilst there are matches still to be found.

## Task 3
Fix the error that occurs when trying to print a congratulations message once the game is over.

## Extension Challenges:
- Can you find out how to make the game randomly shuffle the cards at the start of each game?
- can you add validation so that only valid integers (within the list indices) can be entered and not the same input twice!
- Can you make it so we don't have to write each card name twice in the initial list?
- Can you print the number of turns the player took to find all the matches?
- Can you use a procedure to reduce some repeated code in the while loop?
- Could you find a way to combine the available_cards and mask_list into a single list?
