# Shopping Lists

*Constructed By Sahil Karanth*

Try the program for creating and viewing lists then complete the tasks below to improve it.

Afterwards try the extension challenges!

## Task 1
Can you make it print an error message if the user enters an invalid menu choice?

## Task 2
Change the first for loop to a while loop which ends if the user enters "quit"

## Task 3
When printing lists, can you print out each item on a separate line?

## Extension Challenges

- Add a third menu option and function to delete a list
- Add a fourth option and function to add a new item to an existing list
- Add a fifth option and function to delete an individual item from an existing list
- Currently the program makes files called by the name of the list but really they should have a .txt extension. Add the .txt extension to the created filenames but allow the user to enter a file name with or without ".txt" on the end
