# Battleships  
*By Mabel Symes*

In this game, you have to work out the position of your enemy's ships and sink them in as few goes as possible.
Your enemy has:
- 1 aircraft carrier (5 squares long)
- 1 battleship (4 squares long)
- 1 submarine (3 squares long)
- 1 destroyer (3 squares long)
- 1 patrol boat (2 squares long)
On each turn, you fire at a co-ordinate on the grid, which tells you whether you have hit or missed one of their ships. The identity of the ship that you hit is also revealed.
If every part of a ship has been hit, it will be announced that it has been sunk!
Ships are not allowed to overlap or touch, including diagonally.
Good luck!

# MAIN CHALLENGES:
Challenge 1: Fix the line so that the symbol '~' is printed as many times as the length of the message. If you get stuck, look two lines above!

Challenge 2: Fix the line so that 'num' must also be greater than or equal to 0.

Challenge 3: Fix the line so that the word '(sunk)' is added to the end of the message?

Challenge 4: Check to see if the co-ordinate the user is shooting at has already been done. If so, tell them, and if not, run the rest of the code as usual.

# EXTENSION CHALLENGES:
Extension Challenge 1: Can you add a feature that allows the user to choose the size of the grid?

Extension Challenge 2: Can you add some more ships to the ships dictionary, and then pick a random selection of them to be used in the game?

Extension Challenge 3: Can you make it so that, when a ship is sunk, it is displayed in red on the grid? Here is a page that may help:

An example given is to use the colorama module.
