# Circle Guesser

This game draws 3 circles, of increasing size, on the canvas and allows the user to guess the radius for each in pixels.

If their guess is within 10% their guess is accepted, otherwise it is rejected.

## Task 1

Add in a score counter which then prints out their total score (out of the maximum number of goes in the game) once the game ends.

## Task 2

Allow the user to enter a named colour e.g. red/blue etc or a colour code such as #3EA2F as a game setting at the start of the game and draw all the circles in that colour choice instead.

## Task 3

Allow the user to choose a difficulty level of 1, 2 or 3. This should set a tolerance % for their guesses of either 10, 20 or 30% respectively.

## Task 4

Instead of always asking for the radius, randomly in each guess, either ask them to guess the radius in pixels or the diameter in pixels or the circumference in pixels.
