# Christmas Countdown
*By Daniel Weglowski*

I just can't wait till Christmas, I just donâ€™t have enough time to get this code working, can you help?

It shouldn't show my celebration until Christmas actually arrives but it seems to show straight away when I run it!

**Top tip: zoom out a bit for this one! (Ctrl -) About 50% zoom might work nicely.**

## Tasks
Solve tasks 1-3 to get this week's merit:

1. Seems like I am not up to date and so my calendar can't count right, can you fix this?   

2. I ran a few tests in debug mode and found that when I set the time to exactly Christmas it still doesn't give me the celebration message. Make sure it immediately celebrates Christmas because I can't wait even a millisecond more.
 
3. I want to see the days left not just as digits but also spelled out, complete the function for this, you will need to do at least the first 365 numbers but feel free to push yourself and go into the thousands, millions even past decillions if you want.
 

## Extension 1
Count down even more precisely for example how many hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds until Christmas? You might need to upgrade your solution to task 3 to handle these higher numbers

## Extension 2
Make it work like an advent calendar where every day, every day it gives you the option to open up a door with a treat behind it.
