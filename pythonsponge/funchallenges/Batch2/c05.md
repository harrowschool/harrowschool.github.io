# Quiz Gold Steal
**Constructed By Rob Earle**

This quiz game allows the three players to gain gold and steal it off each other every time they get a question right.

If you run it, you'll find it works but needs some improvements!

## Task 1
Find a way to add one or more questions of your own to the game.

## Task 2
Change the code to randomise the prize award and steal percentage each time. 
Hint: you will want to use the random library!

## Task 3
An output is missing if the current player makes a mistake.
Figure out what it should be and where to add it.
  
## Task 4
Sometimes there isn't anyone to steal from!
Modify the code to allow the player to choose whether to steal or whether not to steal in return for an extra £25 in the bank.

## TASK 5: 
Create another rule/feature of your own to add to this game.

## Extension Tasks
- can you allow the user to say how many players and how many rounds there are?
- can you make it so that bank balances and steal amounts always print to exactly two decimal places e.g. £24.50 not £24.5?
