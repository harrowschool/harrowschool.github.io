# Calculation fun
*Constructed By Finlay Lumsden*

Your starter-code will run - but you won't get any stars!

See if you can complete the calculation tasks to get all 5 stars!

## EXTENSION
- There are shorter code ways to do all of these tasks in python - can you discover any of them?
- On the last question the negative number uses a minus sign but we know binary can only use 0 and 1 so can you find out how computers actually represent negatives using a system called two's complement?
- (or could you even change the code for the last challenge so that the two's compement binary representation is added instead with no minus sign needed?)
