# Goto function

_By Abhinav Gupta_

## Tutorial Two: Functions

**Goto can also be used to define functions.** Normally you could make a function to find the range of a list of numbers like this:

```Python3
def Range(myList):
	return max(myList) - min(myList)
```

However python goto does not support using functions so instead we can call a block of code by going to the line of the function and passing a return line once completed. This means the function can be called from anywhere and the result can always be stored in a variable called `output`.
