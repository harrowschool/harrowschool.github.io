# Goto function task

_By Abhinav Gupta_

## Task Three: Functions

**Fix the code to use the functions correctly.** The code should end up asking the user to enter two playing cards and should display them back with their added value.

The code again uses a variable `returnLine` to determine where to return after going to a function.

## Hints

- Scroll up to the functions to find which lines to go to!
- When calling a goto function, set the `returnLine` to be exactly one after the goto call.
