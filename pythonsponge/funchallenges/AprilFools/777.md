# Simple Goto Loop

_By Abhinav Gupta_

## Task One: 777

**Print the first 111 multiples of 7 to the console.** Normally you could use the following loop:

```Python3
for number in range(0, 778, 7):
```

This would create a loop that goes through all of the multiple of 7 in this range, however today you will not be allowed to use `for`. Think about how `goto` can be used in a similar way to the previous challenge.

## Hints

- Use the same goto loop as before but counting up. You can set the upper limit to by 777 and make the loop increase by 7 instead of decrease by one.
- What is the condition to end the code? `current >= end`)
- What code do we execute in the goto loop? `current += change`
- Where are we going to in the loop? `goto(6)`
