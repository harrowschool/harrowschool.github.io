# Goto Loops

_By Abhinav Gupta_

## Tutorial One: Loops

Please view the code on the left and see how `goto` is being used to create a loop. Instead of using a for loop to count down from 10, `goto` was used to continue reducing the number and checking if it is zero.

- If the number **is** equal to zero, the code goes to the bottom and terminates.
- If the number if **greater than** zero, the code **goes back up to line 4**, thus forming a loop!

Now have a go with the challenges!
