# Introducing Goto in Python

_By Abhinav Gupta_

## What is Goto?

Goto is a language keyword that is not traditionally used any more (_it is DEFINITELY not good coding practice_). In fact it is so frowned upon these days that most modern coding languages including Python do not support it. **Instead** of using a normal `for` or `while` loop to control code flow in an orderly fashion, `goto` can be used instead to jump to a later or earlier line in the code which allows for achieving selection or repetition. It can also unleashes April Fools' Day carnage in the form of spaghetti code!

## How to use Goto in Python?

To simulate this, I have created a Python function that inputs Python3 code and executes it including supporting our new `goto` command! This code goes to line 4 in the entered code; the line numbers referred to in the goto statement match the line numbers shown in the editor on the left.

```python3
goto(4)
```
