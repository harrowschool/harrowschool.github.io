# Turtle Tree Fractals
*Constructed By Sophie Chiang*

Run the code to enjoy the first fractal tree!

Formally, a fractal tree is one which can be created by recursively symmetrical branching. This means the tree function calls itself twice, one for each side, which you can see in the code.

Now try the following challenges!

## Challenge 1
The current parameters of our tree is (50,5,30).
- change the size of the tree to 70
- change the number of levels to 6
- change the angle of each branch to 35
Experiment with varying each parameter individually to change what the tree looks like. Vary the shape of the tree to your liking. Can you change the colour of the branches and leaves of the tree?

## Challenge 2
Look at the code:
- find which number represents the proportion of how much a branch is reduced in each generation.
Use this [image](https://generativelandscapes.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/f5_variations.png) for a hint.

## Challenge 3
Can you change the code to match one of the trees in the image above?

## Challenge 4
Try drawing *multiple* trees (relocating the turtle inbetween each one using code like lines 5-7). 
Each should start at a different point on the canvas to create a (random?) forest of trees!

## Challenge 5
Look at these [fun examples](https://iternal.us/what-is-a-fractal/#:~:text=Some%20of%20the%20most%20common%20examples%20of%20Fractals%20in%20nature,river%20systems%2C%20clouds%2C%20crystals) of fractals that can be found nature & other interesting examples.
What else could you make by adapting the code?
