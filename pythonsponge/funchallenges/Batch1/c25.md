Here is a game TicTacToe, but it is incomplete!

The coordinates currently work from 1,1 in the bottom left.

Try running it and then try the following challenges!

**NOTE: You'll need to flick to the Canvas tab after each move to see the board**

## Challenge 1
Stop the user from placing a choice outside of the grid (e.g. 4,4).
We need to make sure their x and y choice are both between 1-3 inclusive.

## Challenge 2
We further need to check that the chosen square is empty.
You can use the isEmpty function above to do this

## Challenge 3
We also need to add code to check for a draw, using the isDraw function

## Extension
At the top of the code, experiment with some changes:
- Make some change to the COLOUR and LENGTH constants to try them out.
- If we change LENGTH from 3 to 4 however, what other changes will we need to make?

Could you prevent an invalid entry which isn't of the form digit,digit from crashing the game?

Could you give the user a choice at the start as to whether the board grid has coordinate (1,1) at the bottom-left or top-right?
