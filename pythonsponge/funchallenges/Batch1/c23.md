# Turtle Racers
*Constructed By Rob Earle*

Your starter-code will run but will only draw a start line and nothing else!

Can you scroll down to complete all 4 tasks listed at the bottom of the code to make the race happen?

- use the drawfinishline function below to replace the gap and make a golden finish line by passing in the colour as a string
- choose a number of racers to compete in the race (say 2-5)
- find and call a function that I have written above that can circle the winner by adding a line below
- change some code to allow the user to type in how many racers when the program starts

## EXTENSION
- Try using turtle to make a square around the racetrack preferably using functions (HINT, the screen size is 500 by 400)
- Add small markers to the square to indicate each 10%, 20%, 30%, ... of the race completed
