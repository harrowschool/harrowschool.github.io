# Ingredients List
*Constructed By Sophie Chiang*

The program prints out a recipe list of the ingredients you want to buy.
But we WANT it to look like this below and it isn't quite working with the right border if you try it.

```
______________________
|Ingredients          |
-----------------------
|almond paste         |
|sage                 |
|plum tomatoes        |
|ancho chile peppers  |
|coriander            |
|honeydew melons      |
|unsweetened chocolate|
-----------------------
```

Your challenge is to run it and then make some changes to fix the table right border.

NOTE: it would be 'cheating' to add extra messy spaces into the ingredient items in the list itself - you can do better than that!

## Extension fun challenges

1. Have a play around, add or remove some of your own ingredients to the list.
2. Try adding a really long ingredient. For example, add "chocolate covered strawberries" to the list and run it. What do you notice?
- How can you fix this problem by changing line 30?
- How could you find a way to make it work for all ingredients without needing to update line 30 each time?
3. Without adding numbers to the ingredients themselves, could you make them print as a numbered list (the borders should still work even if there are more than 10 ingredients!)
4. Can you find a different, even better way to solve this problem by investigating python f-strings instead which doesn't require adding multiples of spaces in the code?
