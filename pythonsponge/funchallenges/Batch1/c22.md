# Chess pieces
*Constructed By Jem Bennett*

Your starter-code will run - but can you complete all 4 tasks included in the code?

- Add moves for the KING
- Add moves for the QUEEN
- Represent each piece (in the centre of the grid) with the first letter of its name instead of a `#`
- Print out the pawn value of each piece

## EXTENSION
- add the pawn to the list of pieces with the following moves: `[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)]`
- however, `(1, 2)` is valid only when MOVING whilst the other two move are valid only when CAPTURING
- the two categories should be represented by different characters - devise a way to achieve this
- in fact if the pawn hasn't moved before then it can also move to `(0,2)` - how could you show this also?
