# WORD GUESS
*Constructed By Rob Earle*

Try running this game and then try the following challenges to improve it!

## Challenge 1
Ensure that the player 2's entered letter is always converted to lowercase

## Challenge 2
Add some logic so that player 2's entered letter is only accepted if it is a single alphabetical letter

## Challenge 3
Every time player 2 loses a life, print out a message to state the number of lives they have left

## Challenge 4
Add some code to print out a suitable ending message in all cases

## Extension
- Keep track of the letters that player 2 has already guessed and print out this list of already chosen letters each time
- Change the validation so that player 2 can't enter a letter that they have already guessed
- Allow player 2 to indicate that they want to try guessing the whole word and enter that word (subtract one life if wrong)
- Produce some graphical output of the lives lost e.g. of a stick person walking a plank!
