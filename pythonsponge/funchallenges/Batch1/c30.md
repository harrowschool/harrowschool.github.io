# ANAGRAMS
*Constructed By Finlay Lumsden*

This is an anagram game where you can score points by entering the full solved anagram but also any shorter words that can be made from these letters. The more words you can enter in the time permitted, the higher the score.

Try running the code, then completing the tasks below.

## Task 1
We need to print out the player's letters scrambled so add some code to shuffle the letters. Add a line which uses the random shuffle function to shuffle the list of letters.

## Task 2
Can you change the scoring so that the score for a word is doubled if it is a full length word? Is there already a variable storing the full word length in the code you can use?

## Task 3
Stop the user from guessing the same word again. How might you do that? We do not need any new variables or lists to achieve it.

## Extension

- There is a 1/120 chance that the shuffle shuffles the word into the same order as the original word! This is approximately 0.83% for a five letter word. Can you make sure that the anagram posed in not in the same order as `wordChoice`?

- Here there is a word list of 100 words delimited by newline characters (Unicode character 10) The unicode characters for these words are all stored in this list as if it is a string. Can you add a new 6 letter word to the word list? If that works, then can you add the smaller words it may contain?
