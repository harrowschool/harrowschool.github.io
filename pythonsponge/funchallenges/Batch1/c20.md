# Formatting Strings
*Constructed By Rob Earle*

The program uses the f-string technique to insert variables into printed text & to format how they appear.

Your challenge is to complete each task in turn (scroll down the code) and run it after each one to claim your next gold star.

Can you get all four stars?

## EXTENSION
Format specifiers can also be used for many other things, such as padding or aligning text.

Take a look at these examples and then see if you can print out a formatted table with 3 columns which neatly shows, for your grocery list, each item, its quantity and its weight.

```
#print(f"{number:>10}")  # prints the number in a 10 character string (padded with spaces), and right-aligned
#print(f"{number:<10}")  # prints the number in a 10 character string (padded with spaces), and left-aligned
#print(f"{number:^10}")  # prints the number in a 10 character string (padded with spaces) and centre-aligned
```
