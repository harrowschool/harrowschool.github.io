# Cipher Challenge
*Constructed By Ruaidhri Carey*

Here is some unfinished decrypter code to print out a brute force list of all possible decryptions so that you can find the correct plain text and the corresponding encryption key.

Complete the TASKS in the code.

Then try the extensions below.

## Extensions
1. Can you allow the user to enter the message to decrypt?
2. How about offering an encyption and a decryption service?
