# Importing modules

## Exercise 2 (task)

An alternative method of importing involves importing only named items, using the syntax:

`from <library> import <item1>, <item2>, ...`

If using this technique however you have to be careful to avoid hiding library items by use of program variables with the same name so that might involve a different choice of variable names.

Rewrite the code from the last example by completing the blanks to use this new syntax.
