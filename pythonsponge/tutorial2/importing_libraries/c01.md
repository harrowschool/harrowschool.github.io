# Importing modules

## Exercise 1 (example)

Python provides many utility functions, organised into collections called libraries. To call these pre-written
functions in your own code, the library must be imported, by writing `import` followed by the library name at the start
of the program. 

This gives access to the functions and values in that library, referenced in code as
`<module name>.<function name>`.

This program uses the `math` and `statistics` libraries. Other standard libraries include `datetime`, `random`, `timeit`, and `re`.

With a full python installation, you can also install additional modules from the Internet using the `pip` tool, though this cannot be demonstrated on Python Sponge.
