# Rounding and Truncation
## Exercise 1 (example)

You will have seen from GCSE that `int()` truncates a decimal number to keep only the integer part.

`math.floor()` and `math.ceil()` from the `math` library are used to round a decimal down or up to the nearest whole number.

It is tempting to think then that `int()` and `math.floor()` provide the same functionality but they don't as shown in this example.

Can you explain the difference?
