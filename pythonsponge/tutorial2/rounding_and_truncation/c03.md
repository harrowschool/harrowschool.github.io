# Rounding and Truncation
## Exercise 3 (example)

Confusion and precision errors can both occur when handling decimals.

**Confusion** because 'round()' and f-string formatting codes both use the `round to even` data-science principle with the digit 5 as opposed to the usual `round-up` principle for the digit 5 in mathematics. This is to avoid bias in data or financial processing. 

This means as shown in the example that rounding 1.5 would round up to 2 to 1dp (because rounding down to 2 leaves an even final digit) whereas 2.5 would round down to 2 to 1dp (for the same reason). There are some additional complexities that we won't go into here.

**Precision errors** occur because use of binary fractions (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, etc) to represent decimal numbers often can't be achieved exactly or within the language's allocated number of digits for a floating point representation. These errors in representation can lead to inaccurate outcomes as shown in this example.
