# Creating & Using Records
## Exercise 1 (example)

Records are User-Defined Data Types which consist of **field** names and field values of **different** data types.

This example demonstrates the use of `namedtuple` to create a record which is convenient but has its limitations because tuples are immutable so you cannot change a field value without creating a new instance of the record as shown.

This example also demonstrates the use of enumerations to group related constants together.
