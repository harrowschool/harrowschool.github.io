# Creating & Using Records
## Exercise 3 (example)

A more flexible alternative uses Python's dataclasses.

These support default-values as shown in this example.

**Note**: The line `@dataclass` is an example of a python decorator: you can think of these as identification markers for now which identify, in this case, the code block that identifies a dataclass. This is over-simplistic however and you can have fun exploring the concept of Python decorators via some additional reading.

**Extension**: There is also additional functionality of dataclasses that you can look up but this takes us into Object Oriented Programming which we'll look at in another tutorial.
