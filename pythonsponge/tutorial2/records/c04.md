# Creating & Using Records
## Exercise 4 (task)

Add code at the start to create a dataclass record:
- it should be called Point2D
- it should have two float fields called x & y 
- both of which should have default values of 0.0

The remainder of this code then uses your dataclass and should run successfully.
