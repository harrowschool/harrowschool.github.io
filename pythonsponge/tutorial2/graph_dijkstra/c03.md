# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Exercise 3 (example)

We can also find the shortest path as well as the distance of that path.

To do this, we also create a third array called `previous` to store the previous node in the shortest path from the start to each node.

In this example, Dijkstra's algorithm is performed on the same graph below to find the shortest path between node 0 and node 4.

Run the example and study how it works carefully.
