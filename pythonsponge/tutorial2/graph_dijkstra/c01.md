# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Exercise 1 (example)

Dijkstra's algorithm is a common algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes on a *weighted* graph with *positive* weights.

The algorithm is as follows:

1. Choose a node to start from (the current node) and also the target node
2. Initialise distances to all nodes to be infinite except for the start node which has distance set to 0
3. Consider all the unvisited neighbours of the current node:
  a. Calculate the tentative distance from the start to each neighbour via the current node by adding the shorted distance of the current node from the start to the weight of the edge between the current node and the neighbour.
  b. If the tentative distance is smaller than the shortest distance recorded for that node, update its distance
4. Mark the current node as visited
5. Set the current node to the closest unvisited node from the start
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the current node is the target node

This algorithm is typically implemented using two arrays, visited and distance, which store whether the node is currently visited and the shortest distance from the start respectively. To find the closest unvisited node from the start, a priority queue is typically used with the priority being the distance from the start.

In this example, Dijkstra's algorithm is performed on the graph below to find the shortest distance between node 0 and node 4.

Run the example and study how it works carefully.
