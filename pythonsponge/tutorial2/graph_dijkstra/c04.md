# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Exercise 4 (task)

Another way to in Python to achieve the necessary Priority Queue is to use `heappop` and `heappush` which are functions in the `heapify` library which operate on a normal list.

Fill the blanks to print the shortest path between node 0 and node 4. 

Below is the graph used for this task:

## Extension

Look up more information about heap data structures in order to see why it is suitable in this situation.
