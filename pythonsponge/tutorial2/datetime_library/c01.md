# Using the datetime library

## Exercise 1 (example)

The datetime library can be used to create date, time or datetime objects for calendar operations which represent dates, times or a combination of both.

These objects can be created in different ways as shown including by string-parsing (strp) and can be represented in standard forms using string-formatting (strf).
