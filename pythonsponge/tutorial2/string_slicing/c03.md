# String slicing
## Exercise 3 (example)

String slicing also allows us to step over characters e.g. taking every other character.

To do this we use a third number in the slice e.g. name[0:6:2] would take the characters at index 0, 2 and 4 but stopping and not including the character at index 6.

Interestingly, name[6:0:-2] would start at character index 6 and then also extract character index 4 and 2 but not include character index 0.

Most usefully we can reverse a whole string then by omitting the first and second numbers in the slice (indicating the whole string) but use a -1 as the third number so it works backwards through the whole string.

Tip: notice the position starts from 0 not 1 ... we can this the index of the character within the string and we will use indexes more when we come on to lists.
