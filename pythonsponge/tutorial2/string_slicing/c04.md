# String slicing
## Exercise 4 (task)

Complete this palindrome checker ... to print out palindrome if a sentence when reversed, ignoring spaces and letter-case, gives the same word or not palindrome otherwise.

For example Was it a car or a cat I saw would be a palindrome despite the spacing and the capital W.

Do not make any other changes except completing the gaps and note how we use the string method .replace() to remove all of the spaces by replacing them with the empty string.
