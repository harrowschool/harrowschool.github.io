# Optional parameters and unpacking
## Exercise 3 (example)

If the arguments that you want to provide to a function when calling it are stored in a list, you can 'unpack' that list to provide the values required.

Note the `*` infront of the `myFruits` on the last line which 'unpacks' the list contents and will assign fruit1 to the first value in the list, fruit2 the second value and fruit3 the third value.

Note: if the number of items in the list doesn't match the expected number of parameters then an error will occur. Try adding an extra fruit to the `myFruits` list and checking you also then need to add an extra parameter `fruit4`.
