## Exercise 4 (task)

A list of strings is maintained in order of the length of the strings (shortest to longest) with tie-breaks decided alphabetically (alphabetically earliest first).

Complete the procedure `getInserted` which takes two paramaters `lst`, `word`, which are a list and string respectively. 

It returns a **new list** (without altering the list that is passed in) which consists of the original list but with `word` inserted at its correct location to maintain its correct ordering property (on length and then alphabetical)

## Example call
```
getInserted(['cat', 'dog', 'lion', 'rhino'], 'frog')
```

### Example return
```
['cat', 'dog', 'frog', 'lion', 'rhino']
```

### Example explanation
`frog` is longer than `cat` and `dog` and the same length as `lion` but alphabetically before it.
