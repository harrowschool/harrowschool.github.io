# Subprogram Exercises
## Exercise 3 (task)

Complete the procedure `concatUnique` which takes two paramaters `lst1` and `lst2`, which are both lists of strings, and returns a concatenated string formed by identifying all strings that are either:
- in `lst1` but not in `lst2` or
- in `lst2` but not in `lst1`

... and then concatenating the identified strings in alphabetical order (from the alphabetically first to the alphabetically last)

## Example call
```
concatUnique(['dog', 'cat', 'rat'], ['mouse', 'rat', 'cat', 'frog'])
```

### Example return
```
dogfrogmouse
```

### Example explanation
The three words that are in one list but not the other are `dog`, `mouse` and `frog`. Arranged in alphabetical order they give `dog`, `frog`, `mouse` and then concatenated gives the example output.
