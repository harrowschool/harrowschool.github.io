# Bit manipulation

## Exercise 2 (example)

One use of these operators is bit masking, whereby certain bits of a number can be extracted, while the others are all
set to `0` or all to `1`. Choose a number and an operation in each case to extract the requested bits.

For ease of manipulation, you can write numbers in binary or hexadecimal in code. Use the prefix `0b` for binary or `0x`
for hexadecimal.
