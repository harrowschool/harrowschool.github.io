# Bit manipulation

## Exercise 4 (example)

There are two more bitwise operators: `<<`, or leftshift, and `>>`, or rightshift. These move the left argument's bit
pattern left or right respectively, by a number of binary places equal to the right argument.

`a << b` is equivalent to `a * 2 ** b`, while `a >> b` is equivalent to `a // 2 ** b`. However, bit-shifting is a
faster operation than multiplication, division, or exponentiation, so bit-shifting operators are used for low-level
arithmetic, where they are often faster, and may be more readable.
