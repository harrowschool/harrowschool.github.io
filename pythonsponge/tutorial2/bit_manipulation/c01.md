# Bit manipulation

## Exercise 1 (example)

Computers represent numbers as sequences of bits. Most languages use fixed lengths for these sequences, but Python uses
as many bits as are needed for a given number.

Various operations can be performed directly on bit patterns, regardless of their numeric meaning. Some of these are:

- Bitwise and, `&`. Takes two numbers as bit patterns, and returns the bit pattern that has a `1` wherever **both**
inputs have a `1`, and a `0` everywhere else.
- Bitwise or, `|`. Takes two numbers as bit patterns, and returns the bit pattern that has a `1` wherever **either**
input has a `1`, and a `0` elsewhere.
- Bitwise exclusive or, `^`. Takes two numbers as bit patterns, and returns the bit pattern that has a `1` wherever one
input has a `1` and the other has a `0`, and has a `0` wherever the two inputs are the same.

These are operators like `+` and `%`, so they use the same syntax.
