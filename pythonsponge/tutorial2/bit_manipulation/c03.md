# Bit manipulation

## Exercise 3 (task)

Both `&` and `|` sometimes depend only on one input. If one input to `&` is a 0, the other input doesn't matter; and if
one input to `|` is a 1, the other input doesn't matter. However, `^` does not have this property. This makes it useful
for encryption.

Supposing the text to encrypt was `"Hello world!"`. This could be interpreted as a sequence of numbers according to
ASCII: `0x48656c6c6f20776f726c6421`. Then this could be XOR'ed using `^` with a pre-agreed bit pattern, known as a
one-time pad. Now the only way to reconstruct the original data is to know that one-time pad.

`^` is also its own inverse, so the decryption process is the same.

Fill in the blanks to implement the encryption and decryption process described.
