# Bit manipulation

## Exercise 5 (task)

The Collatz conjecture involves the repeated application of a function which is defined as follows:

- If a number is even, halve it
- If it is odd, instead multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Rewrite this code, which calculates that function, using bit-shifting instead of multiplication and division. To do the
multiplication by 3, arrive at `num * 2` by bit-shifting, then add `num`. You will need brackets around the bit-shift
operation.

Also replace the modulo (`%`) operation with a bitwise operation to extract the least significant bit.
