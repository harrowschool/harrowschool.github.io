# Dictionaries and Sets

## Exercise 1 (example)

The `list` is one of several data types which represents a collection of items. Specifically, lists represent a
collection with:
- elements in some defined order
- potentially multiple copies of the same element
- lookup of elements by their position

However, we may want to represent a collection with different properties. For instance, we might not care about, or even
want to define, an order on elements. In that case, we could use a `set` instead of a `list`. Sets also don't allow
multiple copies of an element.

You may think we might as well use a list even if we don't care about order; but sets are also faster than lists for
some operations, especially when storing many elements.

Beyond not tracking order or being able to contain duplicates, sets also have the disadvantage that they can only
contain hashable elements. Essentially, mutable objects like lists, dictionaries, or other sets cannot be stored in a
set.

A `set` is defined like a list, but using curly brackets (`{}`) instead of square brackets. Sets have a `remove` method
like lists, but to add elements you must call `add` rather than `append`.

Run the code inputting a small number (less than 10) to see sets in action, and then run again with larger numbers
(a few thousand) to see how the list operations slow down while set operations remain relatively fast.
