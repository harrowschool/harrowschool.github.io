# Dictionaries and Sets

## Exercise 2 (task)

A few more points of set syntax:
- The empty set is denoted `set()`. Empty curly brackets `{}` are used for the empty dictionary which we will see later.
- The **union** operator `|` can be used to combine sets by taking every element that's in either of the input sets,
  similar to `+` on lists. Eg `{1, 2, 3, 5, 6} | {3, 4, 6, 7}` = `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`
- The **intersection** operator `&` combines sets by taking every element in both inputs.
  Eg `{1, 2, 3, 5, 6} | {3, 4, 6, 7}` = `{3, 6}`

Rewrite the code to use sets rather than lists wherever it is possible to do so without breaking the code.

Remember that sets aren't ordered and cannot contain duplicated elements. One of the code blocks relies on order, and so
should continue to use a list.
