# String formatting
## Exercise 3 (example)

You can use f-strings to display numbers rounded to a specified number of decimal places.

Inside curly brackets, after the variable or expression you add a colon and then a formatting instruction e.g. .2f in the example below means fixed-point 2 i.e. rounded to 2 decimal places.

Tip: try changing the 1 in the .1f instruction. Note also how we can use pi (3.14159...) from the math library if we import it first.
