# String formatting
## Exercise 1 (example)

f-strings (short for format strings) are created by putting the character f before the open quotes.

This allows us to insert variables or expressions directly inside the quoted string if we enclose them within curly brackets. 

Tip: try changing the expression in the last formatting expression e.g. to len(subject) * 2
