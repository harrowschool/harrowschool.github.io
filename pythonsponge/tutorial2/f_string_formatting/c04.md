# String formatting
## Exercise 4 (task)

There are two bugs in this code to find and fix.

The code should round the first decimal number entered to the number of decimal places requested by the user given a choice of 0, 1 or 2.

Don't make any other changes to the code.
Tip: how could you achieve this with less code? You might look up the round() function or also that you can in fact nest curly braces e.g. try using f"{num:.{choice}f}"
