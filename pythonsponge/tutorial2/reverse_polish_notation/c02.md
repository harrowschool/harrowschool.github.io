# Reverse Polish Notation

## Exercise 2 (task)

Fill the blanks to express the infix expression shown below in Reverse Polish Notation and evaluate it using a stack.

Hint: If you are stuck on converting the infix into RPN, follow these steps:
    1. Process each token (operator / operand) from left to right.
    2. If you find an operand, give it an index that is incremented at every turn (e.g. first token = 1)
    3. If you find an operator and the two operands it acts on have been processed already, give it an index, otherwise skip it and return later once the operands have been processed.
    4. Write out each token in the order of the index they have been given to get the RPN

Below is an example of how this process can be applied to the infix expression "(3 + 4) * (1 + 2)":
