# Reverse Polish Notation

## Exercise 3 (example)

Reverse Polish Notation can also be obtained from the **post-order traversal** of an expression tree. 

An expression tree is a binary tree that represents an arithmetic expression, with operators making up parent nodes and operands making up leaf nodes.

Below is the expression tree for the infix expression:

```
(3 + 4) * (1 + 2)
```

Below are the steps to traverse a tree in post-order starting with the root node:
1. Recursively traverse starting from the left child node (if there is one)
2. Recursively traverse starting from the right child node (if there is one)
3. Output the current node

Run the example and study how it works carefully.
