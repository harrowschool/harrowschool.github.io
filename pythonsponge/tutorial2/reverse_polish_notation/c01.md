# Reverse Polish Notation

## Exercise 1 (example)

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is an alternative way of writing a mathematical expression, commonly used by computers to evaluate expressions using a stack. RPN is an example of post-fix notation, where the two operands (numbers) come first and then the operator comes last.

Typically, humans write using infix notation, which is where the operator is sandwiched in between the two operands (numbers)
  * E.g. `3 + 4` is infix notation, as the `+` is in between the two operands `3` and `4`
  * In RPN, the infix expression `3 + 4` is expressed as `3 4 +`, so that the two operands `3` and `4` come before the operator `+`

RPN is a desirable notation for computers because it can be easily used in conjunction with a stack to evaluate RPN expressions. It also eliminates the need for brackets because precedence rules for operators are no longer required.

Below describes the steps to evaluate an RPN expression on a stack:
1. Initialise an empty stack
2. Loop through all tokens (characters / numbers) in the RPN expression from left to right
  * If the token is an operand (value), push it onto the stack
  * If the token is an operator, pop twice from the stack, evaluate using the operator and push the result back onto the stack
3. The result of the evaluation can be found at the top of the stack (which should only have 1 item)

Be careful that the second operand is popped first and the first operand is popped last due to the LIFO nature of a stack
(This will affect operations where the order of the operands matter, e.g. subtraction or division)

This example shows and traces how a RPN expression is evaluated on a single stack.
Run the example and study how it works carefully.
