# Dictionary methods

## Exercise 2 (task)

Some mathematical functions can't be cleanly inverted because they can map multiple different inputs to one output.
However, we can represent the inverse as a function from numbers to sets of numbers. (We can call these sets
"preimages".)

Complete the code to implement a dictionary whose keys are integers and whose values are sets of integers, first using
`setdefault`, then with a `defaultdict`. Recall that dictionaries need their keys to be hashable, so a set cannot be
used as a key, but it may still be used as a value.

You can use the function `set` as the factory function to create an empty set, or write a lambda function.
