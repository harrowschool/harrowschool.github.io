# Dictionary methods

## Exercise 4 (task)

By default, a `for` loop iterates through only the keys of a dictionary, and `in` checks for membership as a key.

To iterate through or check membership of the set of values, use `.values()`. The returned object has the type
`dict_values` but it can be treated like a list for the purposes of iteration or checking membership, and you can cast
it to a list using the `list` function if necessary. (The `.keys()` method mentioned at the end of the last section has
a similar type.)

You can also use `.items()` to get the set of key-value pairs as a sequence of tuples.

Complete the code to invert a dictionary, first in a for loop and then in a comprehension. The inverted dictionary
should have its keys as the original dictionaries values, and its values as the original's keys.

Note that when iterating through the sequence of tuples returned by `.items()`, you can put both the key and the value
straight into separate variables like so: `for key, value in dictionary.items():`. This is the same syntax used with
`enumerate` and indeed works with any sequence of tuples.
