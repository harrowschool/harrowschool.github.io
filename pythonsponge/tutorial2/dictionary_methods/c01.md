# Dictionary methods

## Exercise 1 (example)

This code uses a dictionary to represent a bag: a set which may contain multiple copies of a given element. We simply
use strings as the keys, and integers as the values to count the number of occurrences of a given string.

However, we effectively have `0` of every element that isn't in the bag. We can't use every string as a key of the
dictionary, so instead we use `0` as the default element.

The `get` method of a dictionary can be used with one argument equivalently to square bracket element access, but it
can also be used with a second argument specifying a default to return if the queried key is not present.

The `setdefault` method is similar, but if the queried key is absent, we also set the value of that key to the
specified default.

Finally, a `defaultdict` is a special type of dictionary from the `collections` library, which automatically sets
a default whenever an absent key is queried. In order to find the default, it calls a **factory function**, which is
specified on initialisation as shown. The factory function takes no arguments and returns the default value. You can
optionally pass a second argument when creating the `defaultdict` to create it with existing mappings.
