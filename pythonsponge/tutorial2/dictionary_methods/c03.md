# Dictionary methods

## Exercise 3 (example)

We've seen how to create dictionaries from dictionary literals. You can also create them using a comprehension (see
List Comprehensions) or by calling `dict` on a list of tuples.

In Optional Parameters and Unpacking we saw the positional unpack operator `*` for passing elements of a list as
individual arguments to a function. There is also the keyword unpack operator `**` which passes a dictionary of
keyword-value mappings as individual keyword arguments, provided the keys are all strings.
