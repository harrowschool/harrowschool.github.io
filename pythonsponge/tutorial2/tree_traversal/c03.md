# Tree Traversal

## Exercise 3

One of the main applications of in-order tree traversal is to output the contents of a binary search tree in ascending order.

A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node represents a value / number, and each node to the left of any given node is smaller than that node, and every node to the right is greater than that node (for ascending order). As a reminder, a binary tree is a rooted tree where each node has at most two children nodes.

Binary search trees can be used to sort an array of numbers by inserting items into the tree and using in-order traversal to output the contents of the tree in order.

In this example, in-order tree traversal is used to output the contents of the binary search tree given below.
Run the example and study how it works carefully.
