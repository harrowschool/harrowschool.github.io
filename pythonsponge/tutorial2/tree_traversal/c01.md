# Tree Traversal

## Exercise 1 (example)

Tree traversal algorithms are algorithms that visit the nodes of a tree exactly once in a particular fashion. 
As a reminder, trees are connected, undirected, acyclic graphs, so tree traversal algorithms are a form of graph traversal.

There are three main ways of traversing a tree:
* Pre-Order: Parent node is traversed first, then the two child nodes
* In-Order: First child node is traversed first, then the parent node, and then the second child node
* Post-Order: Two child nodes are traversed first, then lastly the parent node

Since tree traversal is done depth-first, the stack data structure is used to keep track of what node needs to be traversed next.
Hence, tree traversal is commonly implemented recursively to use the call-stack.
Keep in mind that since a tree is acyclic, we do not need to keep track of which nodes have been visited as there is only one way to get to each node from the root.

In this example, all three tree traversal algorithms are performed on the tree below.
Run the example and study how all three tree traversal methods work carefully.
