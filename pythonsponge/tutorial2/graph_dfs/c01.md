# Depth First Search Algorithm

## Exercise 1 (example)

Depth first search (DFS) is a common graph-traversal algorithm which explores the nodes of a graph starting from a starting node.

In DFS, nodes that are found *latest* will be visited *earliest*. So DFS uses a stack data structure to keep track of the unvisited nodes:
 
1. Start by selecting any node and push it onto a stack.
2. Pop the top item from the stack and mark it as visited.
3. Push any unvisited adjacent nodes onto the top of the stack.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the stack is empty.

In this example, depth first search is performed on the graph below. Run the example and study how the algorithm works.
