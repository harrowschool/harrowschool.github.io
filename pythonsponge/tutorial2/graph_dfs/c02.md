# Depth First Search Algorithm

## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete the blanks to represent the graph below. 

Then rearrange the remaining lines and set the correct indentation, without making any changes to the code, to perform depth-first search to traverse the given graph, printing the order in which nodes are explored.

Below is the graph used for this task:
