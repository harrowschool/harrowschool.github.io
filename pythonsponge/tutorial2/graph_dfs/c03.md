# Depth First Search Algorithm - Recursive

## Exercise 3 (example)

DFS can also be implemented recurisvely, neatly utilising the call-stack to allow backtracking.

This is more often used as a theoretical demonstration of the algorithm than for real-world usage, unless the graph is known to be small, because of the wastage of time and memory in creating calls on the call-stack as well as the risk of hitting a maximum recursion depth.

In this example, depth first search is performed on the graph below. 

Run the example and study how the algorithm works.
