# More file handling inc. binary

## Exercise 3 (example)

As we know, files contain binary numbers but those numbers don't have to correspond to ASCII character codes.

The binary numbers might just be a list of numbers for example (each expressed in binary) but opening the file in a text editor would show random characters & symbols without meaning because a text editor would interpret them to be ASCII character codes.

Try running this example which opens a file which contains 6 bytes in binary mode.

Note the `"rb"` setting for opening the file meaning 'read binary'.

In this mode, the file `.read()` method gives us a byte array which we can convert to a list and you can see the 6 bytes stored.

If you look at the data.bin panel at the bottom of the page it will try to interpret these 6 bytes in the file as if they are ASCII codes but of course in this case they just mean 6 numbers, perhaps for mathematical purposes e.g. finding the total as shown on lines 4 and 5.

But what in fact if this file was really meant to be considered as 3 numbers, each stored as 2 bytes? In that case we'd have to decide whether it was stored in little-endian or big-endian form namely whether the number stored as bytes <x> <y> should be interpreted as

```
x * 256 + y
```

or as

```
y * 256 + x
```

Run this example and study the code carefully to show how we can also read two bytes at a time in either format. Try changing it to 3 bytes at a time!
