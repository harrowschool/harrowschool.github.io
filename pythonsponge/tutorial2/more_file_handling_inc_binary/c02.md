# More file handling inc. binary

## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete this example to show how `.writelines()` can be particularly useful if line breaks are not needed.

It will be stored in the file as a continuous string i.e.

```
XXXXXOOXXOOXXXXXXOOXOXXOOXXOXOOX
```

On this occasion that all of the file data is read into a single variable using the `.read()` method.

We then split it back up in chunks of four.

Note: if you did want to use `.writelines()` but have each item in the list of strings written to a new line of the file you would need to append the `\n` character at the end of each list item.
