# More file handling inc. binary

## Exercise 1 (example)

Using a `with` block allows us to define the lifetime of the file object: it will automatically be closed at the end of the block so we don't need to manually close it.

This example also demonstrate the append mode 'a' to add additional content on to the end of an existing file.

Note also that if printing out all of the lines in a file then we can utilise the string `.join()` function and in this case we join them with nothing (the empty string) inbetween each line because the necessary new line characters are already present on the end of each list item.
