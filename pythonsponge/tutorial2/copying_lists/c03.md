# Copying lists
## Exercise 3 (example)
  
If we slice any or all of a list then we also get a copy.
  
This is nice but as shown below, if we have lists within a list then our nested lists are not copies, they still reference the same lists.
  
To fix this we use deepcopy from the copy library.
