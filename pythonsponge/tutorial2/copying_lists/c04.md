# Copying lists
## Exercise 4 (task)

Use deepcopy to duplicate the home_matches nested list and then reverse the matches for the away fixtures.

Don't make any other changes to the code.

TIP: Before you move on, try changing deepcopy() to list() to prove what would have happened if we hadn't used deepcopy!
