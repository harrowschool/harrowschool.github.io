# Adding and removing list items
## Exercise 1 (example)

As well as adding items to a list you can also remove them.

We can remove an item by specifying its index using the `.pop()` method. We can also remove an item by specifying the item itself using the `.remove()` method.

Note that the remove method only removes the first occurence of the item and gives an error if that item is not in the list.

Tip: you can also clear the whole list using the `.clear()` method
