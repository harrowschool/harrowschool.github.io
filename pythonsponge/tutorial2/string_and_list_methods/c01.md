# More String & List methods
## Exercise 1 (example)

There are a large number of string & list methods, more than you may have been introduced to at GCSE.

You can look these up in the python documentation or other online resources but, by way of example, we'll look here at `.join()` which operates on a list, and `.startswith()`, `.endswith()` which operate on strings.

`.join()` is applied to a list of strings and concatentes its elements using the separater provided as shown in this example.

Note that the elements of the list have to be strings ... try changing the example to use a list of integers instead. How might you convert each item of the list into a string first if needed? The next task shows one option but later tutorial content covers better methods.
