# More String & List methods
## Exercise 3 (example)

`.startswith()` and `.endswith()` can be used on strings to find out whether some specified characters can be found at the start or at the end of the string respectively.

Try this example and also try changing the code from using `.startswith()` to using `.endswith()`.
