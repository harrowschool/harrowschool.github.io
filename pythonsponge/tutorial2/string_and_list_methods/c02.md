# More String & List methods
## Exercise 2 (task)

Rearrange the code (which will be inserted where shown) to: 

- convert the elements of the primes list into strings and store in a new list
- use the `.join()` method to print out this new list, comma seperated.

Note: you'll see some better options for converting all list items to strings later on.
