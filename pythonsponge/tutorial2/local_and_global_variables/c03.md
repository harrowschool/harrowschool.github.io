# Local and Global Variables
## Exercise 3 (example)

Variable `shadowing` can occur when a sub-progam has a local variable or a parameter with the same name as a global variable.

Try running this code and see that the message **doesn't change** as intended.

One easy fix would be to include the line `global message` as the first line of the sub-program. Give it a try!

This would not be good practice however because global variables should be avoided so the next task asks you to come up with a better fix.
