# Local and Global Variables
## Exercise 1 (example)

Local variables only exist whilst a sub-program is running; they can also only be accessed within the subprogram. We say they have local scope.

Global variables continue to exist for the lifetime of the program:
* they can be accessed within sub-programs to read or call methods on
* they can only be changed within a sub-program if the variable is declared as global at the start of the sub-program.

It is not good practice to use global variables inside a sub-program:
* if the sub-program changes the variable then we say the sub-program has a 'side-effect' which can cause issues for debugging
* even if it only reads the variable then a dependency has been created on the wider code which means the sub-program cannot as easily be re-used in other programs

Instead, required information for a sub-program should always be passed in as parameters and the sub-program, if a function, should return a result without any other side-effects to the wider program.

This example shows a sub-program with bad practice and a sub-program with good practice for comparison.
