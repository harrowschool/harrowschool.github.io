# Local and Global Variables
## Exercise 2 (task)

Rewrite this code to achieve the same effect but avoid the use of the `global` keyword & also uses a parameter to receive the word to score which you should call `word_to_score` instead of accessing the global variable `word` inside the function.

The sub-program scores a word by counting the number of vowels it contains.

## Example input
```
Rabbit
```

## Example Output
```
your score is 2
```
