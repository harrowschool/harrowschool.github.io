# Local and Global Variables
## Exercise 4 (task)

This code was introduced in the last example but it has a problem because the sub-program creates a shadow local variable rather than changing the global-variable as intended.

Find a fix for this which does not involve using the `global` keyword whilst still keeping the solution decomposed into a sub-program which returns the new message.

The output should not change apart from a corrected output to:
