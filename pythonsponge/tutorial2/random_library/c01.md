# Pseudo-random number generation

## Exercise 1 (example)

Generating data or making decisions at random can be useful for modelling, cryptography, and games. This is usually
done by generating a random number and transforming that into whatever data is needed.

In practice, computers do not generate truly random numbers since they are deterministic machines. Instead, we use
difficult-to-predict algorithms to generate "pseudo-random" numbers which are good enough for most purposes.

Python's pseudo-random number generation exists in the `random` module which must be imported. Then we can use
`random.randint` to get a random integer from a range.

Unlike with `range`, the end value we provide is inclusive â€“ so this program may generate `1`, `2`, `3`, `4,` or `5`.
