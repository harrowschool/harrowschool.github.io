# Psuedo-random number generation

## Exercise 3 (example)

The `random` library provides some further convenience methods for working with sequences.

The `random.shuffle` method reorders a list at random. Note that it modifies the inputted list object rather than
returning a new shuffled list.

The `random.choice` method chooses at random from the list.

The `random.sample` method chooses a number of items from the list without replacement â€“ so they are all different.
