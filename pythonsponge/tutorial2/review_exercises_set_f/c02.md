# Review exercises set F
## Exercise 2 (task)

Ask the user for two indexes from 0 to 5. Then slice out the items between these two indexes including the items at the indexes requested and print them out on one line comma-separated.

For example given the list shown below, if the user enters 1 and 3 the output will be:
```
William,Sayeeta,Trevor
```

Note how we can use the `min()` and `max()` functions to ensure that it doesn't matter which order the user enters the two indexes.

Don't make any other changes.
