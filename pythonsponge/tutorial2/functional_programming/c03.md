# Functional programming

## Exercise 3 (example)

Various standard higher-order functions form the backbone of functional programming by serving similar roles to `for`
loops, `if` statements, etc. Python has some of these built in and some available through the `functools` module.

`map` is a higher-order function which inputs a function and a list. The function is called on every element of the
list, and the return value is a sequence of the results.

Python's `map` returns a generator rather than a list. A generator can be used in a `for` loop without conversion, but
in some cases it is sometimes necessary to pass the result to the function `list` to convert it.
