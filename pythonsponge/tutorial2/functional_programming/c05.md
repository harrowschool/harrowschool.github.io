# Functional programming

## Exercise 5 (task)

Using `map` and `reduce`, apply these operations to the list:

- Add one to each element
- Then convert each element to a string
- Then concatenate each element. No initial value is needed.
- Using the sequence of integers again, now convert the result back from a generator to a list by using `reduce` and the
`add_to_list` function. You will need an appropriate initial value.
