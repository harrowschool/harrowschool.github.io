# Functional programming

## Exercise 2 (task)

A function that takes another function as input or returns another function is called a higher-order function. Both
`create_printer` and `get_function_name` are higher-order functions. `create_printer` also demonstrates the definition
of a function inside another in order to return it.

Fill in the blanks to write code that chooses a function from the list according to user input, and does the following:

- Assigns the chosen function to a variable
- Passes the chosen function as an argument to `get_name`
- Passes the name to `create_printer` to get the printer function as a result
- Calls the printer function using brackets
