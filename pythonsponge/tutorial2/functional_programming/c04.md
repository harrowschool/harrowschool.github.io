# Functional programming

## Exercise 4 (example)

`reduce`, also known as fold, is a higher-order function often used alongside `map`. It takes three arguments: a
function, a list, and an initial value. The inputted function must have two parameters. The inputted function is called
on the initial value and the first element of the list; then it is called on the result of that call and the second
element of the list; then on that result and the third element; and so on. `reduce` returns the final result after the
whole list has been processed.

Python puts `reduce` in the `functools` module, which must be imported.

One usage of `reduce` is to sum or multiply all elements of a list. A neutral value, or identity, is chosen as the
initial value: adding 0 to a number, or multiplying by 1, has no effect. Alternatively, the initial value can be omitted
to start with the first element of the list instead.
