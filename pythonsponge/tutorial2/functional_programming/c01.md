# Functional programming

## Exercise 1 (example)

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which functions and expressions are paramount, mostly or entirely
replacing traditional control flow and statements. Functions are considered objects in the same way as lists or strings:
they can be passed in and out of other functions, used in expressions, and assigned to variables. Objects of this kind
are called "first-class citizens".

Python treats all functions like this. To manipulate a function without calling it directly, write its name without
brackets. Then brackets can be used after any expression which evaluates to a function to call that function.
