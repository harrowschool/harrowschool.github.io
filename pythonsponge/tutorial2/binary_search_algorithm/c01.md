# Binary Search Algorithm

## Exercise 1 (example)

If data is ordered then we can use a binary search algorithm to find if a particular item is in the data or not with a greater efficiency than using a linear search approach of checking each item in turn.

A binary search of n items will have time complexity $O(log(n))$ which on average will be faster than the time complexity $O(n)$ of the linear search which might have to check every item. 

This is because at each comparison, the binary search approach can eliminate half of the data (halving the search space). This approach shows how to do this by using `low` and `high` index pointers which are updated after each comparison, having checked the middle item of the two and updating either the `low` pointer to be `mid + 1` or the `high` pointer to be `low - 1` until either the item is found or high becomes less than low which indicates that the target is not in the list.

Run the example and study its approach carefully.
