# Binary Search Algorithm

## Exercise 3 (example)

*Binary Search in a file* through *direct access* (seeking) is possible if the records are sorted by the key field used for searching and are the same length.

Look at the records in the file which consist of an Employee ID (5 characters), sorted alphabetically, and a date of birth.

Then run the example to look up a date of birth via an Employee ID entered using binary search.
