# List slicing and methods
## Exercise 1 (example)

Slicing a list allows us to extract part of a list into a new list.

It uses a similar syntax to our earlier examples on slicing a string inc. square brackets and the option to miss out numbers in the brackets to mean the start or the end of the list.
