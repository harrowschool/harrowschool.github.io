# Using enumerate with lists
## Exercise 1 (example)

We can use the `enumerate()` function to access both the character position AND ALSO the character itself.

Note how the two loops below give the same output but the second is much neater!

Tip: notice the position starts from 0 not 1 ... we can this the index of the character within the string and we will use indexes more when we come on to lists.
