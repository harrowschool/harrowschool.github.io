# Using enumerate with lists
## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete this code to use `enumerate()` to print out the index positions of any vowels in a word.

For example if the user enters `rabbit` then the output should be 

```
1
4
```

because the character at index 1 is a and the character at index 4 is i.

Do not make any other changes except completing the gaps.
