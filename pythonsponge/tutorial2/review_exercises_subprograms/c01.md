## Exercise 1 (task)

Complete the procedure called `getInterleaved` which takes two string paramaters `s1` and `s2` and returns an interleaved string using the
- first character of s1
- then the first character of s2
- then the second chracter of s1
- and the second character of s2
- ...and so on...

If the strings are not of equal length then once one string is exhausted then the output should just be followed by all the characters of the remaining string.

## Example call
```
getInterleaved("dog", "cattle")
```

### Example return
```
dcoagttle
```
