## Exercise 2 (task)

Similarly, now complete the procedure called `getInterleaved` which takes two string paramaters `s1` and `s2` and returns an interleaved string using a different method:
- first character of s1
- second character of s2
- third chracter of s1
- fourth character of s2
- ...and so on...

If the strings are not of equal length then once one string is exhausted then the characters that would have come from that string are just omitted and it countinue taking *every other() character from the remaining string.

## Example call
```
getInterleaved("dog", "cattle")
```

### Example return
```
dagte
```
