# Arrays vs Lists
## Exercise 3 (example)

With Python lists we can use helpful methods such as `.insert()` to add items into a list at a given index.

But we should not be under an illusion that this is an 'immediate' operation for Python*.

Instead, behind the scenes, most Python implementations will be shuffling down items in contiguous memory to make space for the new item.

This is demonstrated in this example where the time to append 10,000 items on the end of the list is quite different from the time to insert 10,000 items at the start of the list.

**Extension:** 
Investigate the use of `deque` from the `collections` library if your task principally involves adding items at the start and end of a list (and not direct access at specified indexes which is then slow). You can also look at installing the `blist` library which has much better performance on large lists than the standard Python list.
