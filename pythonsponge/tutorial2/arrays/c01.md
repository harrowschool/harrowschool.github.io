# Arrays vs Lists
## Exercise 1 (example)

Arrays are fixed-length, static, ordered compound data structures containing elements of the same data type. 

Elements are accessed using one or more indexes depending on the dimension of the array.

Python lists on the other hand, which are not actually arrays, can grow or shrink dynamically using operations such as `.append()` and `.pop()`.

It is possible to create a Python array structure (fixed length with elements of only one data type) if you import `ctypes` as shown but this is not commonly done.
