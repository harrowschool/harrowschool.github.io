# Static Priority Queues
## Exercise 2 (task)
  
Complete the gaps to turn the queue into a circular priority one, thus solving the problem of queue creep.


For example if objects `ball, bat, stumps, bails, helmet, box` are added with corresponding priorities of `4,3,2,1,5,6` then the queue would be rightly full with contents in the order:

```
box
helmet
ball
bat
stumps
bails
```

But if an item is dequeued (removing `box`), leaving a space at the front of the data structure then it should be possible to enqueue `pads` with priority `3` to leave the contents in the order:

```
helmet
ball
bat
pads
stumps
bails
```
