# Nested control structures
## Exercise 2 (task)

Complete this code to identify whether the positive integer `num` entered is prime or not.

Note: A positive integer is prime if it has exactly two factors (1 and itself). We only need to test for others factors up to the square root of the number because factors always come in pairs and one of the two is always less than or equal to the square root of the product.

##Extension
If generating a list of primes then there are much more efficient ways than testing numbers in turn. Also, if testing primality on a very large integer, the method shown here is too slow and 'evidence of primality' is considered instead. This is well worth reading up on some more.
