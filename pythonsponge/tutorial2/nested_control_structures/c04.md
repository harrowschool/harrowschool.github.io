# Nested control structures
## Exercise 4 (task)

A number sequence starts with first term 1 and then subsequent terms are produced by 'describing' the previous term as follows:
* The second term of the sequence describes 1 as ‘one 1’ which is then written as 11.
* The third term describes 11 as ‘two 1s’ which is then written as 21.
* Following this pattern, the fourth term describes 21 as ‘one 2, one 1’, which is written as 1211. 

Given a positive whole number n as input, complete the code to output the nth term of the sequence.

**Example Input:**

4

**Example Output:**

1211
