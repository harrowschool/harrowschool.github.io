# Data structures as parameters
## Exercise 1 (example)

Be careful if you pass in a mutable (changeable) variable such as a list into a function as a parameter.

Python variables consist of references so when you provide an argument for a parameter then you are specifying a reference to the original variable. This is perfectly safe for immutable types such as integers, floats or strings because any operation on these types always returns a new instance rather than changing the original. 

However with mutable types such as lists, if you change the paramter within the function, you will have changed the original argument as well which you may or may not want.

**Tip:** to stop the outside list from changing, you could first create a list copy using e.g. `temp_lst = list(lst)` at the start of the function but this would not create copies for nested lists so you might need to investigate deep copy options.
