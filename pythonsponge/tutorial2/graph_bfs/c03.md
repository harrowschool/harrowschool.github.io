# Breadth First Search Algorithm

## Exercise 3 (example)

BFS can be used to find the shortest path, as measured by the number of edges, between two nodes in an *unweighted* graph.

In this example, breadth first search is performed on the graph below to find the shortest path between nodes 5 and 8. 

Run the example and study how the algorithm works.
