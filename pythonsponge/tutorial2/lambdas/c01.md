# Lambdas and partials

## Exercise 1 (example)

Often in functional programming, a function is used once as an argument to a higher-order function, and never again.
Defining functions out-of-line with `def` is therefore cumbersome: it takes up space and forces the programmer to name
them. Many langauges therefore provide a way of defining functions inline, known as lambdas.

Unlike functions defined with `def`, Python lambdas cannot execute statements. They simply evaluate an expression in
terms of their arguments, and return the result.

The syntax for a lambda is `lambda arg1, arg2: expression`. Sometimes this needs to be bracketed to eliminate ambiguity.
This expression can then be used directly in place of a function name.
