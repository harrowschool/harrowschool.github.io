# Lambdas and partials

## Exercise 3 (example)

Another cornerstone of functional programming is partial application. A function can be passed some of its required
arguments to yield a new function, which is then called when its remaining arguments are passed.

Python uses the `functools.partial` function for this. The first argument is the function to apply partially. Then any
number of additional arguments can be supplied, which will become the leftmost arguments of the partially applied
function when it is called. Arguments can also be passed by keyword in order to match a specific parameter of the
partially applied function.
