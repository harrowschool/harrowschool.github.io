# Turtle example

The python turtle here (built on top of the javascript Real Turtle project), currently facilitates most basic python turtle instructions for pen, fill, colors and position control, sufficient for GCSE tasks.

For use here, after importing turtle, turtle objects must be initiated e.g.

```
my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()
```

before initiating commands to the turtle object as shown.

Our implementation here does not currently provide all python turtle functionality including reading the state of the turtle or control of the screen size (which is fixed at 500 by 400).
