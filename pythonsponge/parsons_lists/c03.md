# Using lists
## Exercise 3

**Drag in these two lines (in this order) to set up a colours list and a new colour choice**

```
colours = ["blue", "green", "indigo", "red", "yellow"]
colour = input(f"enter a new colour not in {colours}: ")
```

**Then complete the code to add the new colour to the list but keeping the list alphabetically ordered. Finally print out the updated list.**
