This principle of dynamic programming is that it is often efficient to iterate upwards building 'partial results' that are then available to later calculations.

This could also have been implemented using a recursive function (a function which calls itself) so long as you 'memorise' (store in a dictionary) all previous results calculated so that the code doesn't continually recalculate them. See if you demonstrate the 'recurse & memorise' approach for an alternative solution. You might also want to research other dynamic programming problems where the dynamic principle isn't as easy to spot/apply.
