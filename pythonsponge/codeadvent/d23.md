# Day 23

Santa just won't stop ringing on the red phone - it always takes the elves by surpise how stressed he is at this time of the year and they can't think why. Will they ever fit in time to solve the Senior Elf's Great Decrypt Christmas puzzle?

Anyway needsmust and in the meantime Santa has some more urgent work to do on coding the sleigh to algorithmically recognise villages of houses, this time based on their coordinates.

Any house a distance of 10 or less sm (sproutmetres) from any other house is considered to be in the same village as that house. The elves have long measured distance not as the crow flies but as the Manhatten distance, namely the absolute difference in x-coordinates added to the absolute difference in y-coordinates.

Consider the houses at coordinates:

```
10,10
18,12
25,14
40,50
45,53
```

Here there are only two villages present: one consisting of the houses at:

```
10,10
18,12
25,14
```

...and the other consisting of the houses at:

```
40,50
45,53
```

Note that (10,10) is a Manhatten distance of 19 (25 - 10 + 14 - 10) from the location (25, 14) but they are still in the same village because they are both a distance 10 or less from (18, 12).

For your Task Puzzle Data, find and output how many villages there are.

For the example data, your answer should be:

```
371
```
