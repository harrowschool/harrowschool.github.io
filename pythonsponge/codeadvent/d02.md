# Day 2

The string of ten lights which hang outside ElvesLight's new offices are controlled by the Senior Elf herself.

Each year she produces a long number which is programmed in to control their sequence.

All lights start off but each second the next digit of the number is read (from your Task Data File) and this light numbered from 0 to 9 is toggled from its current state either off to on or on to off.

The state of the ten lights can be represented as a string of ten characters with \* for an on light and . for an off light.

For example if the number was 09518590 then:

- light 0 would come on
- light 9 would come on
- light 5 would come on
- light 1 would come on
- light 8 would come on
- light 5 would go off
- light 9 would go off
- light 0 would go off

The final state of the lights when the sequence ends would be represented as:
._......_.

The actual light sequence to be used is in your Task Data File.

Find and output the final state of ElvesLight's lights to solve today's code advent challenge.
