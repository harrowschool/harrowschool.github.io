Investigate other sorting algorithms that could replace the Bubble Sort method here. You could look at Merge Sort for instance or you could see how you can use the built in Python .sort() function by providing the function to handle the comparions. You can also investigate how to shorten the code in the functions e.g. by looking at Python's `zip()` function.
