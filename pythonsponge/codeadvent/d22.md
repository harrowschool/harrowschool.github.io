# Day 22

ALERT ALERT: the red Santa phone has started flashing. All talk of Great Decrypt Chistmas puzzles must be paused for the moment.

The Senior Elf answers the phone quickly. They should have expected an urgent job or two for ElvesLight as Santa gears up for his big sleigh ride.

Santa needs to know how many regions certain towns are divided into. He usually has a Senior Region Elf on the sleigh to glance down and tell him but that elf has just gone off sick and he will need some code to do this for him loaded into the sleigh's onboard computer.

Neighborhoods are represented on a 2D grid where each house is marked with '.', and borders between regions are marked with @ characters. A region consists of all houses which are connected by combinations of horizontal and vertical steps via other houses and don't cross a border path.

For example consider:

```
........
.@@@@@@.
.@.@@.@.
.@.@@.@.
.@@@@@@.
........
```

Here we have three regions:

- the outer region all around the edge of the grid
- and two inner regions each containing just two houses

Find and output how many regions there are in your puzzle input data.

For the example data then, your answer should be:

```
3
```
