# Day 4

As additional revenue generation, ElvesLight have been asked to arrange Secret Santa for all the elfployees at Elf Central.

Since every elfployee has a unique randomly assigned 8 digit staff id number, and always on the look out for an economising shortcut, ElvesLight just decide to sort the elves by this number into ascending order and then assign each elf's secret santa to be the next elf in the list with wrap-around from end to start where needed.

For quality control purposes, a checksum will be found by multiplying each id by that of its assigned secret santa and adding these together.

For example given the ids:

```
44997696
23508970
85887750
14393096
57742651
```

In sorted form we have:

```
14393096
23508970
44997696
57742651
85887750
```

So the checksum would be 14393096 x 23508970 + 23508970 x 44997696 + 44997696 x 57742651 + 57742651 x 85887750 + 85887750 x 14393096 giving a final result of:
10190079607735586

Calculate and output the checksum from the allocations of all elfployees at Elf Central (your Task Data File).

For the example data provided, your code should give the answer:

```
10190079607735586
```
