# Day 13

Solve today's challenge and then enter your answer back on the challenge site.

For the example data, your answer should be:

```
66
```

Note that when you run it with the real data you will need to wait a few seconds before you get the answer - see extension 1!

## Extension 1

ElvesLight Senior Researcher would like to make the code run quicker for large testing data sets (i.e. make the algorithm more efficient). You can do this by finding out how to replace the list of houses with instead a set of tuples e.g. initially

```
houses = {(0, -1)}
```

Instead of appending you then add to a set e.g. `houses.add((x,y))` and you can remove the test to see if the point is already included because the great thing about sets is that they don't have duplicates so any duplicated coordinate would just not count! Try this change and see how much quicker it makes your code!

## Extension 2

The code could be shortened from all the selection clauses if you could use a dictionary which looks up a current (chx, chy) and a direction e.g. L and returns the new (chx, chy). Can you find out how to implement that?
