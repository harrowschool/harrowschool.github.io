# Day 9

Elvish Dancing is a regular feature of the post-work down-time at ElvesLight.

Nineteen of the elves are currently signed-up and they are currently practising the following routine, starting from the all arranged in a straight line.

- the middle elf steps forward
- and then sidesteps their way to either the end or the start of the line
  (their choice alternates each time, starting with moving to the end of the line)
- this process repeats endlessly getting faster and faster usually until they eventually all collapse although this can take a long long time

Having watched them one day, Santa has posed the senior researcher elf a puzzle to label the initial elves A to S as they first line up and then generate the string of their current arrangement after a certain number of elves have stepped forward and moved.

For example, imagine Santa asks for the arrangement after 5 movements.

Initially they are lined up: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS
In the first movement, J leaves the line and move to the end: ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSJ
In the second movement, K leaves the line and moves to the start: KABCDEFGHILMNOPQRSJ
In the third movement, I leaves the line and moves to the end: KABCDEFGHLMNOPQRSJI
In the fourth movement, L leaves the line and moves to the start: LKABCDEFGHMNOPQRSJI
In the fifth movement, H leaves the line and moves to the end: LKABCDEFGMNOPQRSJIH

So the final arrangement is:

```
LKABCDEFGMNOPQRSJIH
```

Find and output the final arrangment for Santa's choice of number of movements to simulate (your Task Data File).

For the example data provided, your code should give the final arrangement given above.

But note this may be too slow for Santa's main data unless you can find a way of spotting how often the elves are back in their original positions and using this to your advantage to skip most of the movements out!
