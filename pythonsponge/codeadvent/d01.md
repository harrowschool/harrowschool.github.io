# Day 1

To celebrate the countdown to Christmas, try solving one of these challenges a day to complete your Code Advent! If you like these, you should also take a look at the long-running and very popular [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website.

To save money in a tight year, Santa has delegated present-administration to ElvesLight, a new start-up division within Elves Central.

Their first task is a bit of book-keeping. Santa has 12,000,000,000 sprouts (the current North Pole currency instigated after the last North Pole Bankruptcy saga) to spend on all of his presents.

He provides ElvesLight with a list of all his sprout expenditure so far on presents (your Task Data File d01.txt). Calculate and output his remaining funds to solve today's code advent challenge.

For the example data, you should generate the answer:

```
11999999963
```

You can then uncomment lines 11-13 to read data from your real data file instead.

## Extension

Can you change the code to use a neater `for .. in ...` loop structure to make it shorter?
