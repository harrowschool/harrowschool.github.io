# Day 12

When Santa visits a house during a present drop he often asks his elves to look all the way around the perimeter of the dining room to identify and milk or cookies left out for him which he might have missed.

The shape of the dining room will be marked using X characters within a wider grid of . characters.

For example consider the small room plan shown below with a few alcoves:

```
........................
.XXXXXX....XXXXX..XXX...
.XXXXXX....XXXXX..XXX...
.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
.XXXXXX.........XXXXXXX.
.XXXXXX.........XXXXXXX.
........................
```

As a measure of the perimeter for job-duration assessment principles, the elves count the number of X characters which have at least one adjacent dot in any direction including diagonals.

In this case the characters changed from X to Y below indicate a border character. There are 68 of them so the elves record the perimeter as being 68.

```
........................
.YYYYYY....YYYYY..YYY...
.YXXXXY....YXXXY..YXY...
.YXXXXYYYYYYXXXYYYYXYYY.
.YXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXY.
.YXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXY.
.YXXXXYYYYYYYYYYYXXXXXY.
.YXXXXY.........YXXXXXY.
.YYYYYY.........YYYYYYY.
........................
```

Calculate and output the perimeter using this measure for your test input given in your Task Data File.

Note that there is a border of at least one dot around all parts of the room in your test input.

For the example data, your answer should be:

```
68
```

## Extension

The code runs a little slowly because of all the Xs being considered which are in the middle of the grid. Would there be any way of speeding this up by following the border instead?
