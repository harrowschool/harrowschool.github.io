# Day 8

In one of the weekly ElvesLight company blue-sky brainstorming sessions, after the usual suggestions to improve lunch and provide free fruit at breaktime, a junior elf points out that now sprouts are the new North Pole adopted currency, it isn't actually that hard to grow some to increase company assets.

This isn't actually a bad idea so the Senior Elf writes it down and gets to business investigating using the Gen 7.3 magic sprout plants which Santa distributed last Christmas.

They plan to utilise sprout plants in certain cells of a 2D grid of soil as distributed by a slightly unmethodical elf. Each sprout plant will drop a seed in all adjacent cells of the field (including diagonals) which in time will generate one sprout. If two seeds land in one cell then only one of them will take seed and produce a sprout. If a seed lands in a cell where a plant is, it cannot produce a sprout and the cell remains as a plant.

For example imagine the following 2D grid with plants marked as P and soil marked as .

```
.....
.P...
..P..
.....
```

In time this will render sprouts as shown below with S.

```
SSS..
SPSS.
SSPS.
.SSS.
```

In total then 12 sprouts will be produced.

For their actual field of plants (your Task Data File), find and output how many sprouts will be produced.

For the example data provided, your code should give the answer:

```
12
```

## Extension

Could you solve the code in a neater way e.g. by investigating sets?
