# Day 6

Personalised mugs are big business and Christmas and Santa has asked ElvesLight to investigate a secure method for storing two uppercase initials that might be printed onto a mug e.g. FB for Fred Blogs.

After some initial research their senior researcher suggests Elfcryption is used.

To decrypt an elfcyrpted string back into the two initials that it represents, repeatedly execute the following process until only two initials are left:

- remove the last letter from the string
- find the alphabetical position of that letter (where A=1, B=2 ...)
- count through the remaining letters (with wrap-around) that many times
- increase the letter you finish on by one letter in the alphabet (with wrap-around Z-A)

As an example consider `GZFD`.

First remove D which is position 4 in the alphabet. Counting around the remaining letters from the start four places gives G, Z, F, G so it finishes back on G which is incremented one letter to H. There are still more than two letters so the letter F is then removed from the end. This is the 6th letter in the alphabet so counting round H, Z, H Z, H, Z means we finish on Z which is increased one (with wraparound) back to A.

There are now only two letters left thus the decrypted initials are: HA

ElvesLight are nothing if not secure so they suggest a one thousand character string for each pair of elfcrypted initials. Decrypt the test data (in your Task Data File) to light up the next row of your code advent tree!

For the example data provided, your code should give the answer:

```
HA
```

Good luck!
