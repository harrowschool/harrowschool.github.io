# Day 16

ElvesLight have branced off into working on a communication system that encodes messages to Santa using binary representations.

Because their messages will include negative numbers on occasions, they are investigating how to represent negative whole numbers using the two's complement representation for 8-bit numbers from -128 to 127.

In this system, the most-significant column (left-most bit) is worth -128 rather than 128 but the other columns are still worth positive values of 64, 32, 16, 8 , 4, 2 and 1 respectively.

For example encoded as 8-bit two's complement form:

```
-127 = 10000001
65 = 01000001
```

To test their understanding the elves plan to make a summary binary number by concatenating specific bits from these converted binary numbers: take the first (most significant) bit of the first number, the second bit of the second number, and so on, wrapping around as necessary e.g. the first bit of the ninth number and so on.

Consider the example input:

```
3
-5
127
-128
```

First we convert into two's complement form:

```
3: 00000011
-5: 11111011
127: 01111111
-128: 10000000
```

The summary number will then be constructed as follows:

```
Take the 1st bit of 00000011 (which is 0)
Take the 2nd bit of 11111011 (which is 1)
Take the 3rd bit of 01111111 (which is 1)
Take the 4th bit of 10000000 (which is 0)
```

So, the summary binary sequence is 0110.

Find the summary binary sequence for your Task Data File.

For the example data, your answer should be:

```
0110
```
