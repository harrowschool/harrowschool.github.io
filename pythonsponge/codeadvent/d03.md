# Day 3

At ElvesLight, the efficiency of wrapping presents is key to their cost savings. It is also better for sustainability combined with their switch to in-house unbleached eco-wrap production.

To avoid over-production they must calculate the amount of wrapping paper needed for each gift load. Presents for the current gift load are stored in their database in the format width x depth x height e.g. 10x12x6 (your puzzle input). Each present requires a wrapping paper area equal to the present surface area plus 20% extra to allow for overlap and wastage. Having summed these calculations, they then round UP to the next 100.

For example, if the gift run consisted of:

```
10x12x6
5x8x3
15x4x9
```

Then the total wrapping paper area required for production would be:
1400

Calculate and output the total area of wrapping paper required for this gift load given in your Task Data File.

For the example data provided, your code should give the answer:

```
1400
```

## Extension

Can you make the code shorter for calculating the surface area and adding on the extra 20%?

Good luck!
