# Day 11

As ElvesLight glance up into the sky, they see Santa's sleigh suddenly performing a strange list of movements in the sky. He has done this once before when telling them the number of presents short he is for his next sleigh run so a quick-thinking elf scribbles down all the movements and passes them back to the recently-appointed senior sleigh decoder.

He stares at the list all ways up for a minute or two and then decides to run it through a turtle interpreter to see what it might do.

Solve today's challenge by executing the list of turtle commands from your Task Data File to see what number Santa's sleigh might have been drawing in the sky.

Don't change the starting position of the turtle which has been set to the left of the turtle screen in order to see the full number generated.

For the example data, your turtle should draw a square.
