# Day 5

For a little Christmas treat, Santa thought it would be fun to send ElvesLight his latest Purchase Order IDs list encoded in base-12 for a nod to the 12 days of Christmas.

To avoid too much confusion he decided to use digits 0-9 as normal but then X for 10 (because if it was good enough for the Romans, it is good enough for him) and then Y for 11.

ElvesLight normal base-10 Order IDs are sometimes 5 and sometimes 6 digits long when expressed in base-12.

Consider:
3X2Y9

Because base-12 is used, from the right the columns are units, 12s, 144s etc

This as its original number would have been:
9 + 11 x 12 + 2 x 144 + ....

To ensure they understand his order request, Santa asks them to convert his list back to the normal number system, add them up and find the remainder when divided by one million.

For example consider the ids:

```
3X2Y9
7YY429
31554
X1288Y
3000X
```

The sum of all the numbers once converted back is 4710163 so the final result that should be obtained is:
710163

Calculate and output Santa's checksum for all of his actual order IDs (your Task Data File).

For the example data provided, your code should give the answer:

```
710163
```
