Solve today's challenge and then enter your answer back on the challenge site.

For the example data provided, your code should give the answer:

```

```

But note this may be too slow for Santa's main data unless you can find a way of spotting how often the elves are back in their original positions and using this to your advantage to skip most of the movements out!
